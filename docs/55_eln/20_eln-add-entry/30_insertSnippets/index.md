The ELN also allows to add an unlimited number of meta information. Those meta information can be inserted not only in the procedure but also in snippets. In order to include the meta information you should type `_` followed by the name of the property. For example `_temperature`. The use of meta information allows to centralize all the parameters that change from one reaction to another. This is especially useful in the case of parallel synthesis.
