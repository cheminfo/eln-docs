To define a snippet first associate to it a `key` that is composed of lowercase letters and the define the corresponding sentence. The sentence may contain not only reagents like `r1`, `r2` but also meta information that can be inserted using `_` followed by the meta field name like `_temperature` for example. If a snippet contains those field you will be able to update their values automatically.
