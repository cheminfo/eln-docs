To define user preferences and `snippets` you should click on the `Prefs` button.

### Predefined sentences
![preferences button](editPrefsButton.png)

To define a snippet first associate to it a `key` that is composed of lowercase letters and then define the corresponding sentence. The sentence may contain not only reagents like `r1`, `r2` but also meta information that can be inserted using `_` followed by the meta field name like `_temperature`. If a snippet contains those fields you will be able to update their values automatically.

Each snippet should be associated with a `key` composed of lowercase letters.

You can then insert snippets by typing their `key` that will be automatically replaced and updated with the current values.
