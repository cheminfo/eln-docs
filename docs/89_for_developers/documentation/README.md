# Writing documentation

The documentation of the ELN is hosted on GitHub and the simplest way to correct or improve the text is to directly edit the file on [GitHub](https://github.com/cheminfo/eln-docs).

If you want to get involved more deeply in the update of the documentation it is better to have a local copy of the repository on your computer.
