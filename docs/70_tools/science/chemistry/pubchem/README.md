# PubChem lookup

This view allows searching PubChem information based on a chemical structure.

After drawing a chemical structure, click on the 'Search PubChem' button.

The structure, encoded as a SMILES, will be searched on PubChem, and we will retrieve some important information concerning safety, computed properties and experimental data.

The first tab `GHS` contains a combination of all the safety information submitted to PubChem.

The second tab `GHS Detailed` will display the different providers of the safety information as well as the information they have submitted.

Finally, the 2 last tabs, `Computed` and `Experimental` contain respectively information that can be derived from the chemical structure as well as experimental data about the molecule.
