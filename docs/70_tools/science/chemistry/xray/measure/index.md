## Measure distances, angles and dihedral angles

Using JSmol you can easily measure properties. Some shortcuts are outlined below. To change visualisation style (e.g. spacefill, wireframe etc.), right-click in the JSmol viewer and select the 'Style' tab. To delete a measurement right-click in the JSmol viewer, scroll to the 'Measurements' tab and click 'Delete measurement'. Further visualisation and measurement tools (e.g. surfaces, atom labels etc.) can be found similarly.

### Distance

- double click on the first atom
- double click on the second atom

### Angle

- double click on the first atom
- single click on the second atom
- double click on the third atom

### Dihedral angle

- double click on the first atom
- single click on the second atom
- single click on the third atom
- double click on the forth atom
