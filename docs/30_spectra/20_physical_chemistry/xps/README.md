# XPS

# Analyze Window

In this view, it is possible to drag and drop XPS files (vms files). Every sample usually has a list of spectra associated with it, typically including a wide scan and several individual orbitals. Each spectrum can be visualized by clicking on the name of the file in the list of XPS files.

# Wide scan

By zooming in on individual peaks in the wide scan, a list of possible orbitals and their corresponding binding energies are filtered in the "List of reference values"

# Compare Window

Orbital energies of different samples can be compared in the "Compare" view. In the "List of selected entries", a sample can be searched for by entering the product/sample code in the search box. By clicking on a sample, a list of spectra for different orbital energies appears in the "List of XPS files" below. By clicking on one of these files, the spectra are displayed and the file is listed in the "List of displayed spectra".
Note, that it is advised to only compare charge corrected samples in this way since otherwise, chemical shifts can not be compared.S
