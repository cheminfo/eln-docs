## Upload IR spectra

You can upload an IR spectrum in 3 different ways:

- by dragging your files and then dropping them in the designated zone.
- by clicking on the upload zone and selecting the files to upload.
- by copying the spectrum into the clipboard and then pasting it using CTRL+V (or âŒ˜+V on MacOS).

The format of the file to be uploaded should be jcamp (extension .dx or .jdx), this is the usual format used on most IR spectrophotometers.
