## JCAMP file format

JCAMP is the standard file format for the exchange of spectra and related physical and chemical information between different spectrometers. Ultimately, it is a text file which contains the relevant data in a particular format.

The data is stored using printable ASCII characters and the file can be viewed, corrected and annotated with a text editor. The spectra are stored as a table containing (x,y) coordinate pairs.

Besides the data points, it is possible to store metainformation and make comments. The file extension is .jdx.
