# Spin system

This tool is used to simulate second order J coupling effects that could modify 1D NMR spectra. 
It enables to predict or justify peak multiplicity that we could observe. However, it is not possible to compare the prediction to the real spectra. 

Start by selecting your spin system depending on the number of spins involved (ABC - three spins, ABDC - four spins...) and specify where they appear on your 1H spectra. Add the value of the coupling constant value in between the spins of interest: Ji(hz) corresponds to the coupling with the spin i.
Finally, specify the parameters of the acquisition that could affect the peak defintion. The peaks prediction appear immediately in blue. You can zoom in by selecting one peak and double-click to go back to the full window.

To compare several predictions, use the "Keep" button. It enables to freeze your first prediction, whose spectra becomes green. Coupling constants or chemical shifts can then be modified and the new spectra will overlap in blue.
