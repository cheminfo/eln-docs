### Introduction

This tool allows to calculate the theoretical distribution and monoisotopic mass from a structure as soon as drawn or imported as SMILE code.

**Please use a recent version of Google Chrome !!!**

### Tricks:

 Click right in the window, you can copy smiles, but also chemdraw .mol and  .sdf files
