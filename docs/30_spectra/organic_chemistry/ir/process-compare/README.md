In this view it is possible to upload an infrared spectrum by drag / drop either a jcamp or a text file.

Once the spectrum is uploaded you can visualize the spectrum by clicking on his name.

It is then possible to `ALT + click` in the peak in order to store representative peaks of this sample. The categorisation `S`, `m`and `w` is done automatically based on the highest and lower selected peak.

Don't forget to `Save data` before leaving the page !
