## IR overlay user guide

Click on a sample from the `List of selected samples`. The list of IR spectra available for the sample will appear in the upper module just to the right. Go to the row of your interest and click on either the Red, the Blue or the Green column to have the corresponding spectrum plotted in the chosen color. Choose a different spectrum (it may be from a different sample) and a different color to plot it superimposed over the first one.
