## Upload IR spectra

You can upload an IR spectrum in 3 different ways:

- by drag and drop
- by clicking on the upload zone and selecting the file
- by copying the spectrum in the clipboard and make a CTRL+V (or âŒ˜+V on OsX).

The format of the file should be a jcamp (extension .dx or .jdx) that is a usual
exportation format on all the IR spectrophotometer.
