# Calculate the similarity between spectra

You can either calculate the similarity using one of the predefined similarity fucntion or create a hierarchical clustering.

## Spectra selection, normalization and previsualization

The first step is to select the spectra and you may follow this [tutorial](spectraAnalysis_spectraSelection)

Once spectra have been selected, data normalization filters can be applied and [more information is available here](spectraAnalysis_normalization).

The superimposed spectra can be manipulated without numerous [advanced features described here](spectraAnalysis_visualization).
