3. Table containing all the structures and corresponding article name that match your search
4. Basic information on the selected molecule: name, structure, molecular formula and molecular weight
5. Wikipedia article related to the selected molecule


## Search

When you draw a molecule in tab 1, the list of molecules will automatically update according to your search. The search mode can be set on substructure, exact structure or similarity search, depending on what your are looking for. You can also apply filter on the article name. 

The information tab and the wikipedia article shown correspond to the chemical structure that you drew. To get information about another molecule in the list, simply click on it.
