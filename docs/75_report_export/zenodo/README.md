# Submit data to Zenodo

The deposition of research data in a repository is a common requirement in data management plans. Furthermore, it will help the cheminformatics community to mine curated data and use this data to create new models.
[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) is such a repository that helps researchers receive credit by making the research results citable (based on a DOI).

Using the Zenodo exportation tool, you can easily select samples and submit them automatically to Zenodo. You will receive a DOI that can be cited in a publication or report.

You can find an example of the Zenodo entry that will be produced [here](https://zenodo.org/record/4308638).
