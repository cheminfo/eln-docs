# Submit data to Zenodo

Zenodo helps researchers receive credit by making the research results citable (based on a DOI).

Using this tool you can easily select samples and submit them automatically to Zenodo. You will receive a DOI that can be cited in a publication or report.

Providing an easy workflow to make original data not only fulfill the requirements of many national funding agency but will help the cheminformatician community to get more information and therefore create new models.

You can find an example of the Zenodo entry that will be produced [here](https://zenodo.org/record/4308638).
