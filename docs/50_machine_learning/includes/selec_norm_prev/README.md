## Spectra selection, normalization and previsualization

The first step is to select the spectra :

<SelectSpectra/>

Once spectra have been selected, data normalization filters can be applied :

<SpectraPreprocessing/>

The superimposed spectra can be manipulated without numerous :

<SuperimposeSpectraManipulation/>
