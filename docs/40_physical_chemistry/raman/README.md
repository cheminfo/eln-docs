#Introduction
[Raman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raman_spectroscopy) spectroscopy is an analytical technique mainly used to determine the vibrational modes of molecules. The working principle of such technique relies on a monochromatic light (e.g. visible, near infrared or near ultraviolet) which is shined on a sample and excites the molecule to a virtual energy state for a short time. The emitted photons can present either higher or lower energy than the incident photon and this change in the kinetic energy is known as inelastic scattering which is specific to a molecule's chemical bond.
Raman spectroscopy is often used in chemistry in order to indentify molecules and assessing the chemical bonds present in the molecule.
