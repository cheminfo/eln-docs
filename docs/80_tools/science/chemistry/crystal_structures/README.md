# X-ray upload and processing

This view allows you to upload and visualize CIF and PDB files.

Distance between atoms can be measured and information about the cell will be displayed if available.

## Measure distances, angles and dihedral angles

Using JSmol you can easily measure properties. Some shortcuts are outlined below. To change visualization style (e.g. spacefill, wireframe etc.), right-click in the JSmol viewer and select the 'Style' tab. To delete a measurement right-click in the JSmol viewer, scroll to the 'Measurements' tab and click 'Delete measurement'. Further visualization and measurement tools (e.g. surfaces, atom labels etc.) can be found similarly.

### Distance

- double click on the first atom
- double click on the second atom

### Angle

- double click on the first atom
- single click on the second atom
- double click on the third atom

### Dihedral angle

- double click on the first atom
- single click on the second atom
- single click on the third atom
- double click on the forth atom
