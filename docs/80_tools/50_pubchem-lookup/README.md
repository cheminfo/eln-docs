# PubChem lookup

The PubChem Lookup Tool is a powerful tool that allows users to search and retrieve safety information about chemical compounds based on their chemical structure


To search for a chemical structure, simply draw it using the chemical structure editor provided. Once you have drawn the structure, click on the `Search PubChem` button. The structure, encoded as a SMILES string, will be searched on **[PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)**, and the tool will retrieve information concerning safety, computed properties, and experimental data.

The tool displays the search results in four tabs:

- **GHS**: This tab displays a combination of all the safety information submitted to PubChem. The safety information is presented in a concise and easy-to-read format.

- **GHS Detailed**: This tab provides more detailed information about the safety of the compound. The different providers of the safety information are listed, as well as the specific information they have submitted.

- **Computed**: This tab contains information about the chemical structure that has been computed by PubChem. For example, it displays the number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors.

- **Experimental**: This tab contains physical information measured by different groups, such as the boiling point and the melting point.

- **Identifiers**: This tab provides the more information on the compound, especially the molecular formula, the canonical SMILES code as well as InChI and InChIKey.
