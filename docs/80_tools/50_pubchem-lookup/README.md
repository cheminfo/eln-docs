# PubChem lookup

This view allows searching **[PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)** information based on a chemical structure.

After drawing a chemical structure, click on the `Search PubChem` button.

The structure, encoded as a SMILES, will be searched on PubChem, and we will retrieve some important information concerning safety, computed properties and experimental data.

The first tab `GHS` contains a combination of all the **safety information** submitted to PubChem.

The second tab `GHS Detailed` will display the **different providers of the safety information** as well as the information they have submitted.

The tab `Computed` contains informations about the chemical structure that has been computed by PubChem. For example, we can see the number of hydrogen bond donor or acceptor.

Finally, the last tab, `Experimental` contains physical informations mesured by different groups, for instance the boiling point and the melting point.
