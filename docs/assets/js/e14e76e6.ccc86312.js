This will allow us to have one global documentation page to which we can link if users have questions and in which users can perform a global fulltext search.\\n\\nThere are a few technical difficulties on the way:\\n\\n- _Link to the appropriate pages in the views_: In the views, the documentation currently uses the `uuid` of the view to get the appropriate documentation page from our GitBook project.\\n  We would need to replace this mechanism in some way. In the simplest version, it could be a simple link to page of this documentation website.\\n\\n- _Different deployment might want to have some custom pages._ A solution to this would be that the administrators make their own fork for this repo. Currently, it is solved via git submodules\\n\\n- *Fix the organization:*  In the GitBook project we have a lot of folders and the organization of some pages does not make sense. This needs to be fixed. Possibly, we should rename `introduction`, remove some subfolders and fix the capitalization."}]}')}}]);
