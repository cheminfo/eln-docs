One example of this are sterically demanding substituents. Those might force the molecule to adopt a bent or rotated conformation. This can reduce the overlap between $\\pi$ systems, and hence reduce the mesomeric effect--which will be reflected in the carbonyl stretching frequency."),(0,r.kt)("h4",{id:"ring-strain"},"Ring strain"),(0,r.kt)("p",null,'In several types of reaction the driving force comes from release of so-called ring strain. Ring strain describes that the atoms are forced into a geometry "they do not like". Interestingly, those constrained geometries also have difference responses of neighboring bonds in the case of vibrations. For example, you will see in the animation that the bond lengths have to change much more in the case of small rings than in large rings. This can be thought of inducing a larger force constant, which manifests itself in an absorption at a higher wavenumber.'),(0,r.kt)("h2",{id:"adding-new-series"},"Adding new series"),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"To add a new series, you can right-click and move to the ",(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Series")," layer.\nThere you will be able to edit the curated collections or add new ones.\nTo add a new series, simply add a new row in the table on the top left.
