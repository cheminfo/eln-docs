# Spectra

This view allows you to visualize spectra related to your sample. There are over 20 different file formats supported for spectra, but only the JCAMP-DX file can be visualized in this view. In order to upload new spectra and convert it in a FAIR format, you should go to the specific tile from the homepage. You can either go back to the homepage and select the tile (e.g. `IR spectra` to upload an infrared spectrum, `isotherm analysis` to upload an isotherm) or click on the colored sticker on the top right of the table. You would be automatically redirected to the tile of interest.
