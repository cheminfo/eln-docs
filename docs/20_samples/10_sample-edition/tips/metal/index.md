## Drawing metal complexes

The chemical structure editor (openchemlib) allows drawing metallic bond. In order to draw a 'zero order' bond you need to first draw a single bond between an atom and a metal. With the single bond drawing tool selected you can then click on the bond couple of times in order to get the dotted bond.

The molecular formula will be calculated automatically, and we consider, for this example, 3 different molecules.
