# Structure search

- Choose filter group options: all searches in all structures, mine searches only entries that you have created.
- Draw a structure in the left module.
- Choose between three Search modes:
  - substructure: search for samples containing the given substructure
  - exact: search for exact matches of the structure
  - similarity: search for samples with a similar structure.
- The center module displays the list of matching structures. Select the one you want.
- The right module displays the list of samples associated with the selected structure. Double-clicking a row will take you back to the main tab, with the corresponding sample selected in the List of selected samples.
- Double-clicking a row in the center module will take you directly to the first matching sample.

Structure search uses the same algorithms implemented in [Datawarrior](http://www.openmolecules.org/datawarrior). They are open source and available as part of openchemlib \([https://github.com/actelion/openchemlib](https://github.com/actelion/openchemlib), [https://github.com/cheminfo/openchemlib-js](https://github.com/cheminfo/openchemlib-js)\). Structure edition is powered by [JSME](http://peter-ertl.com/jsme/).
