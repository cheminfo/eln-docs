# How to enter a MF ?

In a molecular formula it is possible to define multiple components, isotopes, non natural isotopic abundance as well as to use groups and parenthesis.

- isotopes will be place in brackets: eg: `[13C]`, `C[2H]Cl3`
- non natural abundance will be specified in curly brackets: eg: `C{50,50}10` means that we have a ratio 50:50 between 12C and 13C
- group abbreviation: you may use in molecular formula groups like `Ala`, `Et`, `Ph`, etc ...
- multiple components should be separated by ' . '. eg. `Et3N . HCl`
- hydrates on non-integer molecular formula may be specify with numbers in front on the MF. ex. `CaSO4 . 1.5 H2O`
- parenthesis: any number of parenthesis may be used. eg. `((CH3)3C)3C6H3`
