# 3D model generation

In this tool you may draw a molecule and create a 3D model (using moloc).

You can also measure distance in the model by double-clicking on a first atom and on a second atom.

You may paste a molfile by moving your pointer over the structure editor and press <kbd>CTRL</kdb> + <kbd>V</kbd>
