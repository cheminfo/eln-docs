will migrate the documentation for the cheminfo ELN to docusaurus. This will allow us to have one global documentation page to which we can link if users have questions and in which users can perform a global fulltext search. There are a few technical difficulties on the way: Link to the appropriate pages in the views: In the views, the documentation currently uses the uuid of the view to get the appropriate documentation page from our GitBook project. We would need to replace this mechanism in some way. In the simplest version, it could be a simple link to page of this documentation website.

In instance, you can: copy to the molecule to the other side of the reaction by clicking on the arrow. click on the white rectangle to delete this selected molecule.

JSME JSME Help and Basic Instructions​ JSME Menu​ shows molecule SMILES clears the editing area (or the current molecule, if structure contains several parts) starts new molecule component (when multipart option or reaction input are enabled) delete mode (click on atom or bond to delete it) deletes functional group - choose this option and then click bond connecting the group with the main skeleton starts atom numbering or reaction mapping (when this option is enabled) query atom / SMARTS (when this option is enabled) switches between allowed charged states on clicked atom reaction input (when reactions are enabled) undo redo next ring will be added as a spiro ring version information and link to the help page input stereo bond, click existing stereo bond to cycle through possible types (up, dowm, orientation) powerful chain tool, allows creation of various chains and rings; click single bond to change it to double allows input of inorganic atoms or atoms in nonstandard valence state (in this case enter the atom symbol enclosed in [], for example the carbene carbon will be [C]) opens functional group popup menu move selected atom useful when drawing crowded structures (visible when enabled in options) Basic Editing​ Rings are added connected by a single bond (when not added to a terminal atom); if you want to add a spiro ring press SHIFT ⇧ when adding it. An alternative way to add a spiro ring (that may be used also on touch devices) is to press the icon; the next ring will be then added as spiro. With single bond selected, a click on existing single bond changes it to double. With the powerful chain tool you can draw chains, saturated rings and by clicking on single bond change it to a double bond. Molecule may be moved by \"dragging\" free space and rotated by pressing also the SHIFT ⇧ key. JSME Keyboard Shortcuts​ If you are using JSME often, learn the following shortcuts. They will speed-up your editing considerably. ESC returns to the standard editing state (carbon, single bond) d or Del starts delete mode atoms C, N, O, P, S, F, L (for Cl), B (for Br), I, H, R bonds - for single bond, = for double bond rings 3..8 for 3 to 8 membered rings, 1 for phenyl and 0 for furyl groups a - COOH, y - NO2, z - SO3H, t - tert. butyl, ft - CF3 Stereochemistry​ Stereochemistry at C4 centers, double bonds and allenes is supported. Use the up / down wedge bonds to indicate stereochemistry at the C4 centers. Remember, that only bonds with a \"sharp point\" towards the atom are considered. When creating SMILES the editor tries to guess missing stereo features, in unresolvable cases an error message is issued and the SMILES without stereo information is created. When the \"autoez\" option is set, SMILES with E,Z stereochemistry on all non-ring double bonds will be generated automatically. Without this keyword (or for ring double bonds) you have to mark a double bond as stereo by clicking on it with the stereo bond button selected. The bond color will change to magenta. Stereochemistry may be completely disabled by the \"nostereo\" option. Atom Numbering​ Atom numbering (marking) is enabled by the option \"number\" (for reaction input this is default). Button appears in the menu. To mark an atom the \"numbering mode\" must be on, selected by clicking the 123 button. The atom number is chosen by pressing respective keys on your keyboard (i.e. 2 or 12); then atom(s) must be clicked. To delete the number pres 0 at your keyboard and then click the atom. Input of Multipart Structures​ By default only non-disconnected structures may be entered. This may be changed by a \"multipart\" option. A button appears in the menu. A new molecule may be started only after clicking this button, then selecting a proper template (atom, ring or bond) and clicking free space in the drawing area. Without clicking the NEW button first clicking the free space has the same effect as in the standard mode (i.e moving or rotation of the last touched molecule). In the multipart mode the button deletes the last touched molecule. Reaction Input​ Reaction input is enabled with the option \"reaction\". Buttons , and appear in the menu and arrow appears also in the drawing area. Now simply draw reactant(s), product(s) and modulator(s) (modulators have to be above the arrow) as explained in the description of input of multipart structures. The arrow button enables simplified input of reactions. After clicking it, the reactant will be copied to the product (including atom numbering, if any). Query Features​ Query button (when enabled in the options) launches a query window that allows creation of SMARTS atom or bond queries by combining various atom attributes. Select the SMARTS options in this panel and then click the respective atom or bond in the molecule. Copy and Paste​ Right mouse click opens the Copy and Paste pop-up menu that allows to copy the molecule as SMILES or MOL file or paste MOL , SDF, or RXN files into the editor. On supported touch devices, the menu can be opened by �touch and hold� on the surface of the editor. Keyboard shortcuts Ctrl C (for copy) and Ctrl V (for paste) are supported on most browsers.

Toxicity risk alerts are an indication that the drawn structure may be harmful concerning the risk category specified. However, risk alerts are by no means meant to be a fully reliable toxicity prediction. Nor should be concluded from the absence of risk alerts that a particular substance is completely free of any toxic effect. In order to assess the toxicity prediction’s reliability we ran a set of toxic compounds and a set of presumably non-toxic compounds through the prediction. The diagram below shows the results obtained by predicting all available structures of four subsets of the RTECS database. For example, all structures known to be mutagenic were run through the mutagenicity assessment. 86 % of these structures where found to bear a high or medium risk of being mutagenic. As a control set served a collection of traded drugs of which the mutagenicity risk assessment revealed only 12 % of potentially harmful compounds. The prediction process relies on a precomputed set of structural fragment that give rise to toxicity alerts in case they are encountered in the structure currently drawn. These fragment lists were created by rigorously shreddering all compounds of the RTECS database known to be active in a certain toxicity class (e.g. mutagenicity). During the shredding any molecule was first cut at every rotatable bonds leading to a set of core fragments. These in turn were used to reconstruct all possible bigger fragments being a substructure of the original molecule. Afterwards, a substructure search process determined the occurrence frequency of any fragment (core and constructed fragments) within all compounds of that toxicity class. It also determined these fragment’s frequencies within the structures of more than 3000 traded drugs. Based on the assumption that traded drugs are largely free of toxic effects, any fragment was considered a risk factor if it often occurred as substructure of harmful compounds but never or rarely in traded drugs.","s":"Toxicity risk assessment","u":"/docs/eln/includes/property_prediction/README","h":"#toxicity-risk-assessment","p":132},{"i":137,"t":"The logP value of a compound, which is the logarithm of its partition coefficient between n-octanol and water log(coctanol/cwater), is a well established measure of the compound’s hydrophilicity. Low hydrophilicities and therefore high logP values cause poor absorption or permeation. It has been shown for compounds to have a reasonable probability of being well absorbed their logP value must not be greater than 5.0. The distribution of calculated logP values of more than 3000 drugs on the market underlines this fact (see diagram). Our in-house logP calculation method is implemented as increment system adding contributions of every atom based on its atom type. Alltogether the cLogP predicting engine distinguishes 368 atom types which are composed of various properties of the atom itself (atomic number and ring membership) as its direct neighbors (bond type, aromaticity state and encoded atomic no). More than 5000 compounds with experimentally determined logP values were used as training set to optimize the 369 contribution values associated with the atom types. The correlation plot (see diagram) shows calculated versus experimentally determined logP values of an independent test set of more than 5000 compounds being different from the training set.","s":"cLogP calculation","u":"/docs/eln/includes/property_prediction/README","h":"#clogp-calculation","p":132},{"i":139,"t":"The aqueous solubility of a compound significantly affects its absorption and distribution characteristics. Typically, a low solubility goes along with a bad absorption and therefore the general aim is to avoid poorly soluble compounds. Our estimated logS value is a unit stripped logarithm (base 10) of the solubility measured in mol/liter. In the following diagram you can see that more than 80% of the drugs on the market have a (estimated) logS value greater than -4. Similar to our in-house logP calculation we assess the solubility via an increment system by adding atom contributions depending on their atom types. The atom types employed here differ slightly from the ones used for the cLogP estimation in that respect that the ring membership is not looked at. Still there are 271 distinguishable atom types describing the atom and its near surrounding. More than 2000 compounds with experimentally determined solubility values (25 degrees, pH=7.5) were used as training set to optimize the contribution values associated with the atom types. The correlation plot on the right shows calculated versus experimentally determined logS. You can see that the precision of the logS estimation is worse than the one for logP. This is because the solubility of a substance depends to a certain extend on how effectively the molecules are arranged in the crystal and these topological aspects cannot be predicted via atom types nor substructure fragments.","s":"logS calculation","u":"/docs/eln/includes/property_prediction/README","h":"#logs-calculation","p":132},{"i":141,"t":"Optimizing compounds for high activity on a biological target almost often goes along with increased molecular weights.

Our approach is based on a list of about 5300 distinct substructure fragments with associated druglikeness scores. The druglikeness is calculated with the following equation summing up score values of those fragments that are present in the molecule under investigation: The fragmentlist was created by shreddering 3300 traded drugs as well as 15000 commercially available chemicals (Fluka) yielding a complete list of all available fragments. As a restriction the shredder considered only rotatable bonds as cuttable. In addition the substitution modes of all fragment atoms were retained, i.e. fragment atoms that hadn’t been further subtituted in the original compounds were marked as such and atoms being part of a bond that was cut were marked as carrying a further substituent. This way fragment substitution patterns are included in the fragments. The occurence frequency of every one of the fragments was determined within the collection of traded drugs and within the supposedly non-drug-like collection of Fluka compounds. All fragments with an overall frequency above a certain threshold were inverse clustered in order to remove highly redundant fragments. For the remaining fragments the druglikeness score was determined as the logarithm of the quotent of frequencies in traded drugs versus Fluka chemicals. The subsequent diagram shows the distribution of druglikeness values calculated from 15000 Fluka compounds and from 3300 traded drugs. It shows that about 80% of the drugs have a positive druglikeness value whereas the big majority of Fluka chemicals accounts for the negative values. Thus, try to keep your compounds in the positive range… A positive value states that your molecule contains predominantly fragments which are frequently present in commercial drugs. What it doesn’t necessarily mean, though, is that these fragments are well balanced concerning other properties. For instance, a molecule may be composed of drug-like, but lipophilic fragments only. This molecule will have a high druglikeness score although it wouldn’t really qualify for being a drug because of its high lipophilicity.","s":"Fragment based druglikeness","u":"/docs/eln/includes/property_prediction/README","h":"#fragment-based-druglikeness","p":132},{"i":145,"t":"The drug score combines druglikeness, cLogP, logS, molecular weight and toxicity risks in one handy value than may be used to judge the compound’s overall potential to qualify for a drug.

It was providing the first substructure search engine on the internet in which you could draw, thanks to a java applet, a chemical structure. This first search engine was done using 4D search engine and at that time even the HTTP server had to be developed using direct access to a TCP library. In 2000, we have also published in a journal that disappeared in the meantime ... a way to share spectra directly on the internet. Later this search engine has been rewritten from scratch in Java and since 2005 research data from the institute of chemistry of the University of Lausanne were stored in a MySQL database. At the beginning it was only possible to store mass spectra, NMR spectra, infrared spectra, ultraviolet spectra, circular dichroism, x-ray structure and chromatography. All the data were converted before importation to the IUPAC supported format: JCAMP-DX. On first January 2008 over 10'000 samples were already created in this database. This project grew, and we quickly reached over 100'000 samples in the database. It was based on one big project that became difficult to maintain and to develop. Moreover, we wanted to have the same code in the browser and on the server and with the disappearance of Java applets it became impossible. In 2014 a group of 4 people (Norman Pellet, Michaël Zasso, Daniel Kostro and Luc Patiny) started to redesign the full system based on a modular approach. At that time JavaScript was becoming a 'real' language and advanced scientific application in the browser could be foreseen. This development has led to over 200 open-source scientific libraries widely used (over 100'000 downloads per week) and exhaustively tested. Those packages are present in the following GitHub organizations: https://github.com/cheminfo https://github.com/mljs https://github.com/image-js Up to now, over 60 developers that have contributed to those projects! Based on those basic building blocks various more advanced projects were achieved.

Spectra selection All the spectra analysis tools start with a phase of selection. Select samples​ In order to facilitate the analysis of the spectra it is advised to have samples containing representative spectra in order to evaluate the intra-variability as well as the reproducibility. Selection of spectra to analyze is achieved with one of those 3 methods: At the level of the sample by either clicking on the +, this will add all the spectra related to this sample or on the + on the top of the sample box to add all the spectra of all the selected samples. If you select a sample it is also possible to add a specific spectrum by clicking on the + at the level of the spectra list. Once spectra have been selected, data normalization filters can be applied : Normalization How to normalize spectra. Preprocessing In order to compare spectra it is required to create a matrix. In this matrix each row corresponds to a spectrum while the columns are the various values for a specific X. To create this matrix we apply various preprocessing methods that consist of: filter the data in order to reduce the impact of sample preparation or experimental artifacts using various filters select the representative part of the spectra that is expected to be important for the analysis remove large peaks not characteristic to the sample (like water in NMR spectra) that could interfere with the analysis reduce the number of points in order to accelerate the analysis apply matrix related processing allowing to normalize the columns Filters​ You may also apply various Filters that allows to normalize or transform the data. Among those filters we have: Center mean Divide by SD (standard deviation) Rescale: set the min value to 0 and the max value to 1 Normalize: set the sum of all the points to 1 Align: create a peak picking between from / to and calculate the mean X value between the nbPeaks highest peaks. The spectrum will be moved so that the mean has the targetX value. Pareto: Pareto scaling, which uses the square root of standard deviation as the scaling factor, circumvents the amplification of noise by retaining a small portion of magnitude information. 10.1016/j.molstruc.2007.12.026 Savitzky-golay: smoothing spectra and calculate derivatives based on the following parameters: windowSize: smoothing window, must be an odd number derivative: enter 0, 1 or 2 polynomial: the degree of the polynomial used to calculate SG X function: a function that modifies the X axis based on the x parameter. Like for example log(x) Y function: a function that modifies the Y axis based on the y parameter. Like for example log10(y+1) One classical preprocessing algorithm is Standard Normal Variate (SNV). This preprocessing can be achieved by selecting the 2 options Center mean and Divide by SD. Selecting the range​ Only the information between the From and To values of the range will be considered. Exclusions​ Depending on the analysis some region should be removed in order to improve the analysis. For example NMR spectroscopy in water yields to a large peak around 4.5ppm and using exclusion zone it can be removed from the analysis. Number of points​ The data normalization process will select equidistant Nb points between the From and To values. Matrix processing​ Once all the previous filters have been applied we obtain a matrix in which rows represent the normalized spectra and columns represent the intensity of teach spectrum. Some filters are using the columns for further processing like: PQN: Probabilistic Quotient Normalization (10.1021/ac051632c) Center mean: for each column the mean of the values will be centered Rescale (0 to 1): for each column the min value will be set to 0 and the max value to 1 Large dataset​ The list of the spectra in the dataset is displayed in the following table: In some cases it is not possible to keep in memory the original spectra and the system will only keep the normalized spectra. Therefore, it will not be possible to change the normalization parameters anymore. Preview​ A preview of the normalized spectra as well as the exclusions zones will be displayed. This allows to fine tune the processing. The superimposed spectra can be manipulated without numerous advanced features described here. The superimposed spectra can be manipulated without numerous : Visualization How to visualize spectra. Spectra visualization Numerous options are available to display the either all the spectra in the dataset or the selected spectra in the dataset. Selection of spectra in the dataset​ The toolbar on the top of the list of spectra in the dataset provides many options (from left to right): Remove all spectra from dataset Select category: select which property contains the category description Download normalized matrix Recolor spectra based on category: a different color will be applied for each category. By default, the sample reference Select all spectra Append to selected spectra Select only current spectra Remove spectra from current selection Unselect all spectra Graph options​ It is possible to either display the selected spectra, all the spectra or various derived information. Customization of the display is achieved using the chart toolbar: Display spectra​ The first options allow to either display all the spectra, only the selected spectra or nothing. Displaying no spectrum is useful when displaying other derived data. Original / normalized​ These options allow to either display the original spectra or the normalized data. Most of the time we will display normalized data. Those are the data that will be analyzed, and normally they also take less room in memory. Boxplot​ The boxplot kind of representation allows to display the first / third quartile as a dark grey zone for each X point. The min and max values are represented as a light gray zone and the median is represented as a line for which the color varies based on the standard deviation (red: high variation, blue: small variation). Tracking information​ By selecting the tracking information you will display the X values and the corresponding Y values for all the spectra. Correlation​ Correlation of the vector represented by the Y points can be useful to determine which peaks are correlated in a big mixture of products. This is known in NMR metabolomics as STOCSY.

It is used to determine content and purity of a sample and analyze molecular structure. The method is based on the Zeeman effect - the splitting of the spectral line in the presence of a static magnetic field. The nuclei under a static field are perturbed by a weak oscillating magnetic field near the resonant frequency of the nuclei. This produces a precession of the nuclear spins around the static magnetic field, which can be detected in the form of voltage induced in a coil. 1H and 13C are the most commonly used nuclei, however others are possible. The basic NMR experiment involves three sequential steps: Alignment (polarization) of the magnetic nuclear spins in a constant magnetic field (Zeeman effect) Perturbation of this alignment of the nuclear spins by a weak oscillating magnetic field, usually referred to as a radio-frequency (RF) pulse Detection of the NMR signal (free induction decay) in the form of oscillating voltage in the detection coil, due to the precession of the nuclear spins around the constant magnetic field The information about the frequency is given as the chemical shift (ppm) which is independent of the magnetic field.

It allows to predict and justify observed peak multiplicities. note It is not possible to compare the spin multiplicity prediction with experimental spectra. Start by selecting your spin system depending on the number of spins involved (ABC - three spins, ABDC - four spins...) and specify their chemical shift (i.e. where they appear on your 1H spectra). Add the value of the coupling constant in between the spins of interest: Ji(hz) corresponds to the coupling with the spin i. Finally, specify the parameters of the acquisition that could affect the peak definition (i.e. magnetic field strength, line width and the number of datapoints). To compare several predictions, use the Keep button. It enables you to freeze the first prediction, whose spectrum becomes green.

Spectra selection All the spectra analysis tools start with a phase of selection. Select samples​ In order to facilitate the analysis of the spectra it is advised to have samples containing representative spectra in order to evaluate the intra-variability as well as the reproducibility. Selection of spectra to analyze is achieved with one of those 3 methods: At the level of the sample by either clicking on the +, this will add all the spectra related to this sample or on the + on the top of the sample box to add all the spectra of all the selected samples. If you select a sample it is also possible to add a specific spectrum by clicking on the + at the level of the spectra list. Once spectra have been selected, data normalization filters can be applied : Normalization How to normalize spectra. Preprocessing In order to compare spectra it is required to create a matrix. In this matrix each row corresponds to a spectrum while the columns are the various values for a specific X. To create this matrix we apply various preprocessing methods that consist of: filter the data in order to reduce the impact of sample preparation or experimental artifacts using various filters select the representative part of the spectra that is expected to be important for the analysis remove large peaks not characteristic to the sample (like water in NMR spectra) that could interfere with the analysis reduce the number of points in order to accelerate the analysis apply matrix related processing allowing to normalize the columns Filters​ You may also apply various Filters that allows to normalize or transform the data. Among those filters we have: Center mean Divide by SD (standard deviation) Rescale: set the min value to 0 and the max value to 1 Normalize: set the sum of all the points to 1 Align: create a peak picking between from / to and calculate the mean X value between the nbPeaks highest peaks. The spectrum will be moved so that the mean has the targetX value. Pareto: Pareto scaling, which uses the square root of standard deviation as the scaling factor, circumvents the amplification of noise by retaining a small portion of magnitude information. 10.1016/j.molstruc.2007.12.026 Savitzky-golay: smoothing spectra and calculate derivatives based on the following parameters: windowSize: smoothing window, must be an odd number derivative: enter 0, 1 or 2 polynomial: the degree of the polynomial used to calculate SG X function: a function that modifies the X axis based on the x parameter. Like for example log(x) Y function: a function that modifies the Y axis based on the y parameter. Like for example log10(y+1) One classical preprocessing algorithm is Standard Normal Variate (SNV). This preprocessing can be achieved by selecting the 2 options Center mean and Divide by SD. Selecting the range​ Only the information between the From and To values of the range will be considered. Exclusions​ Depending on the analysis some region should be removed in order to improve the analysis. For example NMR spectroscopy in water yields to a large peak around 4.5ppm and using exclusion zone it can be removed from the analysis. Number of points​ The data normalization process will select equidistant Nb points between the From and To values. Matrix processing​ Once all the previous filters have been applied we obtain a matrix in which rows represent the normalized spectra and columns represent the intensity of teach spectrum. Some filters are using the columns for further processing like: PQN: Probabilistic Quotient Normalization (10.1021/ac051632c) Center mean: for each column the mean of the values will be centered Rescale (0 to 1): for each column the min value will be set to 0 and the max value to 1 Large dataset​ The list of the spectra in the dataset is displayed in the following table: In some cases it is not possible to keep in memory the original spectra and the system will only keep the normalized spectra. Therefore, it will not be possible to change the normalization parameters anymore. Preview​ A preview of the normalized spectra as well as the exclusions zones will be displayed. This allows to fine tune the processing. The superimposed spectra can be manipulated without numerous advanced features described here. The superimposed spectra can be manipulated without numerous : Visualization How to visualize spectra. Spectra visualization Numerous options are available to display the either all the spectra in the dataset or the selected spectra in the dataset.

By default, the sample reference Select all spectra Append to selected spectra Select only current spectra Remove spectra from current selection Unselect all spectra Graph options​ It is possible to either display the selected spectra, all the spectra or various derived information. Customization of the display is achieved using the chart toolbar: Display spectra​ The first options allow to either display all the spectra, only the selected spectra or nothing. Displaying no spectrum is useful when displaying other derived data. Original / normalized​ These options allow to either display the original spectra or the normalized data. Most of the time we will display normalized data. Those are the data that will be analyzed, and normally they also take less room in memory. Boxplot​ The boxplot kind of representation allows to display the first / third quartile as a dark grey zone for each X point. The min and max values are represented as a light gray zone and the median is represented as a line for which the color varies based on the standard deviation (red: high variation, blue: small variation). Tracking information​ By selecting the tracking information you will display the X values and the corresponding Y values for all the spectra. Correlation​ Correlation of the vector represented by the Y points can be useful to determine which peaks are correlated in a big mixture of products. This is known in NMR metabolomics as STOCSY. By SHIFT ⇧ + ALT + click you can select the X value for which you would like to check correlation.

The information is stored using ASCII characters and the file can be viewed, corrected and annotated with a text editor. The spectra are stored as a table containing (x,y) coordinate pairs. Besides the data points, it is possible to store metainformation and make comments. The file extension is .jdx. A JCAMP document is composed of an unlimited number of Labelled Data Records (LDRs). Each LDR starts with a “##” and ends with “=”. Any space, comma, slash or hyphen is removed and the text is written with capital letters. Some examples of Data Labels: TITLE : title of the experiment END : the last line of the file XUNITS : the units reported on the x-axis NPOINTS : number of points Two important LDRs are “XYDATA” and “PEAKTABLE”, which contain the spectral information. The former gives information in the form of a table where the first value in a line stands for an x coordinate and any subsequent values are y-coordinates with an equidistant increment on the x-axis. The latter provides information as a collection of (X,Y) pairs. It is commonplace to compress the data tables.

An alternative way to add a spiro ring (that may be used also on touch devices) is to press the icon; the next ring will be then added as spiro. With single bond selected, a click on existing single bond changes it to double. With the powerful chain tool you can draw chains, saturated rings and by clicking on single bond change it to a double bond. Molecule may be moved by \"dragging\" free space and rotated by pressing also the SHIFT ⇧ key. JSME Keyboard Shortcuts​ If you are using JSME often, learn the following shortcuts. They will speed-up your editing considerably. ESC returns to the standard editing state (carbon, single bond) d or Del starts delete mode atoms C, N, O, P, S, F, L (for Cl), B (for Br), I, H, R bonds - for single bond, = for double bond rings 3..8 for 3 to 8 membered rings, 1 for phenyl and 0 for furyl groups a - COOH, y - NO2, z - SO3H, t - tert. butyl, ft - CF3 Stereochemistry​ Stereochemistry at C4 centers, double bonds and allenes is supported. Use the up / down wedge bonds to indicate stereochemistry at the C4 centers. Remember, that only bonds with a \"sharp point\" towards the atom are considered. When creating SMILES the editor tries to guess missing stereo features, in unresolvable cases an error message is issued and the SMILES without stereo information is created. When the \"autoez\" option is set, SMILES with E,Z stereochemistry on all non-ring double bonds will be generated automatically. Without this keyword (or for ring double bonds) you have to mark a double bond as stereo by clicking on it with the stereo bond button selected. The bond color will change to magenta. Stereochemistry may be completely disabled by the \"nostereo\" option. Atom Numbering​ Atom numbering (marking) is enabled by the option \"number\" (for reaction input this is default). Button appears in the menu. To mark an atom the \"numbering mode\" must be on, selected by clicking the 123 button. The atom number is chosen by pressing respective keys on your keyboard (i.e. 2 or 12); then atom(s) must be clicked. To delete the number pres 0 at your keyboard and then click the atom. Input of Multipart Structures​ By default only non-disconnected structures may be entered. This may be changed by a \"multipart\" option. A button appears in the menu. A new molecule may be started only after clicking this button, then selecting a proper template (atom, ring or bond) and clicking free space in the drawing area. Without clicking the NEW button first clicking the free space has the same effect as in the standard mode (i.e moving or rotation of the last touched molecule). In the multipart mode the button deletes the last touched molecule. Reaction Input​ Reaction input is enabled with the option \"reaction\".

This is the connection between electronic effects of the substituent and changes in vibrational frequencies. What do we now need to do in practice to get to these eigenvalues and eigenvectors? We need to find an equilibrium geometry. For this, we perform a conformer search and then perform a geometry optimization. We need to construct the matrix F\\mathbf{F}F of second derivatives fijf_{i j}fij​.

If we have this matrix, we can solve the eigenvalue problem and get the normal modes with their frequencies. Conformer search In our case, conformer generation is based on a stochastic algorithm that generates random distances within bounds of minimum and maximum distances of pairs of elements. It turns out that these distance matrices can be projected into three dimensions, i.e., coordinates for every atom. To improve the performance of these distance geometry algorithms they are often refined using information, such as preferred torsional angles, extracted from the Cambridge Crystallographic database. Semi-empiricial quantum chemistry vs. force fields In the view, we give the option to select different methods for geometry optimization and calculation of the vibrational spectrum. Force-fields approximate the potential energy surface U(q)U(q)U(q) in some simple parametrization based on interaction terms between different atom pairs --- often for bonds, bends (angles), and torsions (dihedral angles) between different atom types. The force-field we use in the service is called GFN-NN. Its parameters were derived from fitting to DFT derived geometries, vibrational frequencies, and non-covalent interactions of about 8000 structures covering a wide range of chemistry. In contrast to other force field parametrizations it uses an electronegativity-equilibrium (EEQ) atomic-charge model to describe the electrostatic interactions, and it avoids element pair specific parametrization . From a computational point of view, GFN-FF's computational cost scales quadratically with system size. The other methods we offer are semi-empirical quantum-mechanical methods. The key idea behind semi-empirical methods such as the Hueckel method is that they approximate difficult integrals. An important flavor of semiempirical methods are density-functional tight-binding methods where the energy is expanded in terms of density fluctuations relative to a superposition of atomic reference densities: E[ρ(r)]=E[ρ0(r)]+∫δE[ρ(r)]δρ(r)∣ρ0δρ(r)+12∬δ2E[ρ(r)]δρ(r)δρ(r′)∣ρ0δρ(r)δρ(r′)…+1p!∬…∫δE[ρ(r′)]δρ(r)δρ(r′)…δρ(r(p))∣ρ0δρ(r)δρ(r′′)…δρ(r(p))+…\\begin{aligned} &E[\\rho(r)]=E\\left[\\rho_{0}(\\mathbf{r})\\right]+\\left.\\int \\frac{\\delta E[\\rho(\\mathbf{r})]}{\\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{r})}\\right|_{\\rho_{0}} \\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) \\\\ &+\\left.\\frac{1}{2} \\iint \\frac{\\delta^{2} E[\\rho(\\mathbf{r})]}{\\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) \\delta \\rho\\left(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}\\right)}\\right|_{\\rho_{0}} \\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) \\delta \\rho\\left(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}\\right) \\ldots \\\\ &+\\left.\\frac{1}{p !} \\iint \\ldots \\int \\frac{\\delta E\\left[\\rho\\left(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}\\right)\\right]}{\\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) \\delta \\rho\\left(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}\\right) \\ldots \\delta \\rho\\left(\\mathbf{r}^{(p)}\\right)}\\right|_{\\rho_{0}} \\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) \\delta \\rho\\left(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime \\prime}\\right) \\ldots \\delta \\rho\\left(\\mathbf{r}^{(\\mathbf{p})}\\right)+\\ldots \\end{aligned}​E[ρ(r)]=E[ρ0​(r)]+∫δρ(r)δE[ρ(r)]​∣∣∣∣∣​ρ0​​δρ(r)+21​∬δρ(r)δρ(r′)δ2E[ρ(r)]​∣∣∣∣∣​ρ0​​δρ(r)δρ(r′)…+p!1​∬…∫δρ(r)δρ(r′)…δρ(r(p))δE[ρ(r′)]​∣∣∣∣∣∣​ρ0​​δρ(r)δρ(r′′)…δρ(r(p))+…​ The GFN-xTB techniques build on top of this idea. In approximating the integrals, one introduces empirical parameters which in the GFN-xTB scheme are again fitted for atoms -- but not for the pairs (in contrast to conventional DFTB methods). warning Our simulations only consider an isolated molecule in gas phase for which the intensities and frequencies are typically different from the experimental ones. The intensities are particularly worse for the force-field method. Also, we do not consider any broadening effects (e.g., hydrogen bonds, solvents, rotational fine structure).","s":"Spectra from the Hessian","u":"/docs/eln/uuid/10b6a7229db7dd815afcc75e77c2d6cd","h":"#spectra-from-the-hessian","p":610},{"i":618,"t":"Key for the interpretation of the spectra is to realize that a system with NNN particles, has 3N3N3N degrees of freedom. These degrees of freedom can be aggregated into different collective motions of the atoms: 3 degrees of freedom describe the movement of the center of mass in the three spatial directions. To say in other words, the \"first\" three degrees of freedom describe translations. In addition to changing the center of mass, the molecule can also rotate in different ways, which leaves the center of mass fixed. However, we have to make a distinction between linear and non-linear molecules. For linear molecules there is no rotation around the molecular axis -- you can explore this in the view if you compare carbon dioxide and water. For non-linear molecules, however, there are rotations around three distinct axes If we now subtract the translational and rotational modes we have 3N−53N-53N−5 vibrational degrees of freedom for linear molecules and 3N−63N-63N−6 vibrational degrees of freedom for non-linear molecules.

There you can select from different molecule collections, which will be simulated once you click the button. We currently provide a set of collection illustration important effects from organic chemistry, using the carbonyl stretching frequency as \"probe\". The important thing to remember throughout is that a stronger bond implies a higher force constant, which implies a higher wavenumber The inductive and mesomeric effect​ The two most widely discussed effects in organic chemistry are the inductive and mesomeric effect. The inductive effect describes changes in electron density that functional groups induce via σ\\sigmaσ bonds. Electron-withdrawing (electronegative) groups will attract electrons and hence make the neighboring atom more \"positive\". This will have an impact on the bond strength, which will manifest itself in the vibrational frequency. In contrast to that, the mesomeric effect is transmitted via π\\piπ bonds and can be visualized via resonance structures. Again, this has an effect on the electron density in neighboring bonds, which can be thought of changing the force constant and hence the vibrational frequency. Steric effects​ Clearly, there is a relation between structure and geometry. One example of this are sterically demanding substituents. Those might force the molecule to adopt a bent or rotated conformation. This can reduce the overlap between π\\piπ systems, and hence reduce the mesomeric effect--which will be reflected in the carbonyl stretching frequency. Ring strain​ In several types of reaction the driving force comes from release of so-called ring strain. Ring strain describes that the atoms are forced into a geometry \"they do not like\". Interestingly, those constrained geometries also have difference responses of neighboring bonds in the case of vibrations. For example, you will see in the animation that the bond lengths have to change much more in the case of small rings than in large rings. This can be thought of inducing a larger force constant, which manifests itself in an absorption at a higher wavenumber.","s":"Curated collections","u":"/docs/eln/uuid/10b6a7229db7dd815afcc75e77c2d6cd","h":"#curated-collections","p":610},{"i":624,"t":"To add a new series, you can right-click and move to the Series layer.

Spectra selection All the spectra analysis tools start with a phase of selection. Select samples​ In order to facilitate the analysis of the spectra it is advised to have samples containing representative spectra in order to evaluate the intra-variability as well as the reproducibility. Selection of spectra to analyze is achieved with one of those 3 methods: At the level of the sample by either clicking on the +, this will add all the spectra related to this sample or on the + on the top of the sample box to add all the spectra of all the selected samples. If you select a sample it is also possible to add a specific spectrum by clicking on the + at the level of the spectra list. Once spectra have been selected, data normalization filters can be applied : Normalization How to normalize spectra. Preprocessing In order to compare spectra it is required to create a matrix. In this matrix each row corresponds to a spectrum while the columns are the various values for a specific X. To create this matrix we apply various preprocessing methods that consist of: filter the data in order to reduce the impact of sample preparation or experimental artifacts using various filters select the representative part of the spectra that is expected to be important for the analysis remove large peaks not characteristic to the sample (like water in NMR spectra) that could interfere with the analysis reduce the number of points in order to accelerate the analysis apply matrix related processing allowing to normalize the columns Filters​ You may also apply various Filters that allows to normalize or transform the data. Among those filters we have: Center mean Divide by SD (standard deviation) Rescale: set the min value to 0 and the max value to 1 Normalize: set the sum of all the points to 1 Align: create a peak picking between from / to and calculate the mean X value between the nbPeaks highest peaks. The spectrum will be moved so that the mean has the targetX value. Pareto: Pareto scaling, which uses the square root of standard deviation as the scaling factor, circumvents the amplification of noise by retaining a small portion of magnitude information. 10.1016/j.molstruc.2007.12.026 Savitzky-golay: smoothing spectra and calculate derivatives based on the following parameters: windowSize: smoothing window, must be an odd number derivative: enter 0, 1 or 2 polynomial: the degree of the polynomial used to calculate SG X function: a function that modifies the X axis based on the x parameter. Like for example log(x) Y function: a function that modifies the Y axis based on the y parameter. Like for example log10(y+1) One classical preprocessing algorithm is Standard Normal Variate (SNV). This preprocessing can be achieved by selecting the 2 options Center mean and Divide by SD. Selecting the range​ Only the information between the From and To values of the range will be considered. Exclusions​ Depending on the analysis some region should be removed in order to improve the analysis. For example NMR spectroscopy in water yields to a large peak around 4.5ppm and using exclusion zone it can be removed from the analysis. Number of points​ The data normalization process will select equidistant Nb points between the From and To values. Matrix processing​ Once all the previous filters have been applied we obtain a matrix in which rows represent the normalized spectra and columns represent the intensity of teach spectrum. Some filters are using the columns for further processing like: PQN: Probabilistic Quotient Normalization (10.1021/ac051632c) Center mean: for each column the mean of the values will be centered Rescale (0 to 1): for each column the min value will be set to 0 and the max value to 1 Large dataset​ The list of the spectra in the dataset is displayed in the following table: In some cases it is not possible to keep in memory the original spectra and the system will only keep the normalized spectra. Therefore, it will not be possible to change the normalization parameters anymore. Preview​ A preview of the normalized spectra as well as the exclusions zones will be displayed. This allows to fine tune the processing. The superimposed spectra can be manipulated without numerous advanced features described here. The superimposed spectra can be manipulated without numerous : Visualization How to visualize spectra. Spectra visualization Numerous options are available to display the either all the spectra in the dataset or the selected spectra in the dataset. Selection of spectra in the dataset​ The toolbar on the top of the list of spectra in the dataset provides many options (from left to right): Remove all spectra from dataset Select category: select which property contains the category description Download normalized matrix Recolor spectra based on category: a different color will be applied for each category. By default, the sample reference Select all spectra Append to selected spectra Select only current spectra Remove spectra from current selection Unselect all spectra Graph options​ It is possible to either display the selected spectra, all the spectra or various derived information. Customization of the display is achieved using the chart toolbar: Display spectra​ The first options allow to either display all the spectra, only the selected spectra or nothing. Displaying no spectrum is useful when displaying other derived data. Original / normalized​ These options allow to either display the original spectra or the normalized data. Most of the time we will display normalized data. Those are the data that will be analyzed, and normally they also take less room in memory. Boxplot​ The boxplot kind of representation allows to display the first / third quartile as a dark grey zone for each X point. The min and max values are represented as a light gray zone and the median is represented as a line for which the color varies based on the standard deviation (red: high variation, blue: small variation). Tracking information​ By selecting the tracking information you will display the X values and the corresponding Y values for all the spectra. Correlation​ Correlation of the vector represented by the Y points can be useful to determine which peaks are correlated in a big mixture of products. This is known in NMR metabolomics as STOCSY. By SHIFT ⇧ + ALT + click you can select the X value for which you would like to check correlation. Strongly correlated signals will appear in red while non correlated signals are blue.","s":"Spectra selection, normalization and previsualization","u":"/docs/eln/uuid/123afc6387248096bb2ab8bbd1a0bedf","h":"#spectra-selection-normalization-and-previsualization","p":629},{"i":635,"t":"In order to facilitate the analysis of the spectra it is advised to have samples containing representative spectra in order to evaluate the intra-variability as well as the reproducibility.

Also the electronic structure and density of the electronic states of the material can be determined. XPS is often used for the study of chemical reactions or the assessment of novel structures as it shows which elements are present in a particular material and which elements they are bonded. XPS is a technique based on the photoelectric effect, where an X-ray beam hits the material and electrons escape from the surface. These emitted photoelectrons reach then an electron energy analyser, which measures the kinetic energy, as well as a detector that counts the number of electrons. The data obtained corresponds to a spectrum in which the number of electrons are plotted as a function of the specific binding energy [eV] at which they were detected. Each element of the periodic table gives rise to a specific set of XPS peaks which also determines the electronic configuration (e.g. 1s, 2s, 2p, etc.). Similarly, the number of electrons corresponding to each peak is associated to the amount of that particular element within the XPS analysed sample. Analyze Window In this view, it is possible to drag and drop XPS files (vms files). Every sample usually has a list of spectra associated with it, typically including a wide scan and several individual orbitals. Each spectrum can be visualized by clicking on the name of the file in the list of XPS files. Wide scan By zooming in on individual peaks in the wide scan, a list of possible orbitals and their corresponding binding energies are filtered in the \"List of reference values\" Compare Window Orbital energies of different samples can be compared in the \"Compare\" view. In the \"List of selected entries\", a sample can be searched for by entering the product/sample code in the search box. By clicking on a sample, a list of spectra for different orbital energies appears in the \"List of XPS files\" below. By clicking on one of these files, the spectra are displayed and the file is listed in the \"List of displayed spectra\". Note, that it is advised to only compare charge corrected samples in this way since otherwise, chemical shifts can not be compared. Columns customization In many tables it is possible to select which columns to display. This is achieved by clicking on the icon. After clicking on the icon a dialog box opens that allows to add a new column. There are 5 parameters to fill for a new column: name: the column name. This will be displayed as the header to the column. rendererOptions: options that allows among other to format numbers. One very useful formatter is numeral (see after) width: number of pixels for the specific column. May stay empty for automatic layout. forceType: select how to display complex values (see later) jpath: where to find the information to display in the column In order to add a new column you need to select the jpath using the hierarchical drop down menu. Columns can be moved or rearranged as well. rendererOptions: numeral number, Value to format rendererOptions Result 12.345678 numeral:'#.##' 12.34 12.3 numeral:'#.00' 12.30 0.3 numeral:'#.0 %' 30.0 % forceType In the database some values are stored as an object that needs to be displayed to the user in an intuitive way. For example the unit type will store in the database the value using as units SI (we convert the data to the units defined by the 'standard international') and specify in which units the user would like to display the data. So in the following example we are in fact storing the value -150°C by storing the value in SI (Kelvin) and specifying that the user wants to see it in °C. { \"SI\": 123.15, \"unit\": \"°C\"} Copy Another example is the valueUnits type that will store the data in 2 different properties (value and unit). In this case the value is stored in the specified units and there is no conversions. { \"value\": 123, \"units\": \"°C\"} Copy While this way to store the data in the database is very practical it is not the way that the user would like to see his results. We have therefore the possibility to forceType: define how the user would like to see the results. Other types include mf. This formatter allows to correctly display a molecular formula that is stored in the database as \"C10H20O3\". i.e. it will put the numbers in subscript (C₁₀H₂₀O₃).","s":"X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)","u":"/docs/eln/uuid/12f59c8a0137bfbf28b00fef39bfdf0b","h":"","p":668},{"i":674,"t":"On this page","s":"Add and modify an ELN entry","u":"/docs/eln/uuid/13a5028017f3fdcd3d5c0ce32120e876","h":"","p":673},{"i":677,"t":"To define user preferences and snippets you should click on the Prefs button.","s":"User preferences","u":"/docs/eln/uuid/13a5028017f3fdcd3d5c0ce32120e876","h":"#user-preferences","p":673},{"i":679,"t":"To define a snippet first associate to it a key that is composed of lowercase letters and then define the corresponding sentence.

An alternative way to add a spiro ring (that may be used also on touch devices) is to press the icon; the next ring will be then added as spiro. With single bond selected, a click on existing single bond changes it to double. With the powerful chain tool you can draw chains, saturated rings and by clicking on single bond change it to a double bond. Molecule may be moved by \"dragging\" free space and rotated by pressing also the SHIFT ⇧ key. JSME Keyboard Shortcuts​ If you are using JSME often, learn the following shortcuts. They will speed-up your editing considerably. ESC returns to the standard editing state (carbon, single bond) d or Del starts delete mode atoms C, N, O, P, S, F, L (for Cl), B (for Br), I, H, R bonds - for single bond, = for double bond rings 3..8 for 3 to 8 membered rings, 1 for phenyl and 0 for furyl groups a - COOH, y - NO2, z - SO3H, t - tert. butyl, ft - CF3 Stereochemistry​ Stereochemistry at C4 centers, double bonds and allenes is supported. Use the up / down wedge bonds to indicate stereochemistry at the C4 centers. Remember, that only bonds with a \"sharp point\" towards the atom are considered. When creating SMILES the editor tries to guess missing stereo features, in unresolvable cases an error message is issued and the SMILES without stereo information is created. When the \"autoez\" option is set, SMILES with E,Z stereochemistry on all non-ring double bonds will be generated automatically. Without this keyword (or for ring double bonds) you have to mark a double bond as stereo by clicking on it with the stereo bond button selected. The bond color will change to magenta. Stereochemistry may be completely disabled by the \"nostereo\" option. Atom Numbering​ Atom numbering (marking) is enabled by the option \"number\" (for reaction input this is default). Button appears in the menu. To mark an atom the \"numbering mode\" must be on, selected by clicking the 123 button. The atom number is chosen by pressing respective keys on your keyboard (i.e. 2 or 12); then atom(s) must be clicked. To delete the number pres 0 at your keyboard and then click the atom. Input of Multipart Structures​ By default only non-disconnected structures may be entered. This may be changed by a \"multipart\" option. A button appears in the menu. A new molecule may be started only after clicking this button, then selecting a proper template (atom, ring or bond) and clicking free space in the drawing area. Without clicking the NEW button first clicking the free space has the same effect as in the standard mode (i.e moving or rotation of the last touched molecule). In the multipart mode the button deletes the last touched molecule. Reaction Input​ Reaction input is enabled with the option \"reaction\". Buttons , and appear in the menu and arrow appears also in the drawing area. Now simply draw reactant(s), product(s) and modulator(s) (modulators have to be above the arrow) as explained in the description of input of multipart structures. The arrow button enables simplified input of reactions. After clicking it, the reactant will be copied to the product (including atom numbering, if any). Query Features​ Query button (when enabled in the options) launches a query window that allows creation of SMARTS atom or bond queries by combining various atom attributes. Select the SMARTS options in this panel and then click the respective atom or bond in the molecule. Copy and Paste​ Right mouse click opens the Copy and Paste pop-up menu that allows to copy the molecule as SMILES or MOL file or paste MOL , SDF, or RXN files into the editor. On supported touch devices, the menu can be opened by �touch and hold� on the surface of the editor. Keyboard shortcuts Ctrl C (for copy) and Ctrl V (for paste) are supported on most browsers. Drag and Drop of Files in the Editor​ Some HTML 5 compatible browsers support the drag and drop of files.

An alternative way to add a spiro ring (that may be used also on touch devices) is to press the icon; the next ring will be then added as spiro. With single bond selected, a click on existing single bond changes it to double. With the powerful chain tool you can draw chains, saturated rings and by clicking on single bond change it to a double bond. Molecule may be moved by \"dragging\" free space and rotated by pressing also the SHIFT ⇧ key. JSME Keyboard Shortcuts​ If you are using JSME often, learn the following shortcuts. They will speed-up your editing considerably. ESC returns to the standard editing state (carbon, single bond) d or Del starts delete mode atoms C, N, O, P, S, F, L (for Cl), B (for Br), I, H, R bonds - for single bond, = for double bond rings 3..8 for 3 to 8 membered rings, 1 for phenyl and 0 for furyl groups a - COOH, y - NO2, z - SO3H, t - tert. butyl, ft - CF3 Stereochemistry​ Stereochemistry at C4 centers, double bonds and allenes is supported. Use the up / down wedge bonds to indicate stereochemistry at the C4 centers. Remember, that only bonds with a \"sharp point\" towards the atom are considered. When creating SMILES the editor tries to guess missing stereo features, in unresolvable cases an error message is issued and the SMILES without stereo information is created. When the \"autoez\" option is set, SMILES with E,Z stereochemistry on all non-ring double bonds will be generated automatically. Without this keyword (or for ring double bonds) you have to mark a double bond as stereo by clicking on it with the stereo bond button selected. The bond color will change to magenta. Stereochemistry may be completely disabled by the \"nostereo\" option. Atom Numbering​ Atom numbering (marking) is enabled by the option \"number\" (for reaction input this is default). Button appears in the menu. To mark an atom the \"numbering mode\" must be on, selected by clicking the 123 button. The atom number is chosen by pressing respective keys on your keyboard (i.e. 2 or 12); then atom(s) must be clicked. To delete the number pres 0 at your keyboard and then click the atom. Input of Multipart Structures​ By default only non-disconnected structures may be entered. This may be changed by a \"multipart\" option. A button appears in the menu. A new molecule may be started only after clicking this button, then selecting a proper template (atom, ring or bond) and clicking free space in the drawing area. Without clicking the NEW button first clicking the free space has the same effect as in the standard mode (i.e moving or rotation of the last touched molecule). In the multipart mode the button deletes the last touched molecule. Reaction Input​ Reaction input is enabled with the option \"reaction\". Buttons , and appear in the menu and arrow appears also in the drawing area. Now simply draw reactant(s), product(s) and modulator(s) (modulators have to be above the arrow) as explained in the description of input of multipart structures. The arrow button enables simplified input of reactions. After clicking it, the reactant will be copied to the product (including atom numbering, if any). Query Features​ Query button (when enabled in the options) launches a query window that allows creation of SMARTS atom or bond queries by combining various atom attributes. Select the SMARTS options in this panel and then click the respective atom or bond in the molecule. Copy and Paste​ Right mouse click opens the Copy and Paste pop-up menu that allows to copy the molecule as SMILES or MOL file or paste MOL , SDF, or RXN files into the editor. On supported touch devices, the menu can be opened by �touch and hold� on the surface of the editor. Keyboard shortcuts Ctrl C (for copy) and Ctrl V (for paste) are supported on most browsers. Drag and Drop of Files in the Editor​ Some HTML 5 compatible browsers support the drag and drop of files. Starting with version 2013-03-24, JSME accepts dropping of text files in the format MOL, SDF and RXN. To drag molecule from the editor into the appropriate destination (for example Word or text document, or desktop) drag the icon in the lower right corner of the editor.","s":"JSME Help and Basic Instructions","u":"/docs/eln/uuid/13a5028017f3fdcd3d5c0ce32120e876","h":"#jsme-help-and-basic-instructions","p":673},{"i":694,"t":"A reaction contains various sample.

Specifying the purity of a reagent​ The purity of a reagent may be specified using 3 possibles units: %: purity as mass ratio like 40% HNMe2 in water M (or mM): moles/liter (or mmoles/liter) like 1.6M BuLi L: loading: mole/kg useful for solid phase synthesis Theoretical information The system will calculate continuously the molecular formula of all the reagents and products. Products theoretical information​ When you draw products of reaction the application will calculate continuously the expected quantities for 100% and one equivalent. This value is also updated when you change the quantities in the reagent table. Mixture of solvents There is an easy to deal with mixture of solvents. Calculate mixture of solvents volume to reach specific concentration​ For some reactions it is important to calculate the solvent to reach a specific concentration and in some cases it can be a mixture of solvents. The reagent table allows dealing with mixture of solvent. In this case we would like to work in DMSO/H2O in a ratio (70/30): For the solvents enter the number of equivalent so that the sum is 1 Enter the concentration you want to achieve in the 'Purity' column of all the solvents. Many times the same reagent In some cases it is required to add many times the same reagent. Same reagent multiple times​ In some reactions such as in the example below, the product is formed via the combination of multiple reagent molecules. In this example the mixture of ethylene glycol with triethyl orthoformate yields a cyclic orthoester. In order to enter the quantities for this kind of reaction you need to specify correctly the number of equivalents of the reagent that limits the yield. In this case the triethyl orthoformate limits the yield, so we enter two equivalents for this reagent. This will allow calculating correctly the expected quantity of the product as well Copy structure of the product to a sample In some cases it is required to copy manually the structure of a reaction product. Copy product as molfile​ If a sample was created using method other than from the reaction the chemical structure, molecular formula and molecular weight will not be copied automatically.

That is, if you want to upload a PXRD attachment to your sample you need to open the PXRD view. Explode nucleic and peptidic sequences The editor can explode peptide or nucleic acid sequences. Explode nucleic and peptidic sequences​ Most of the time you enter a peptidic or nucleic sequence as one letters code. However, it may happen that you have the terminal chain modified like in the case of a small tripeptide AAL that would have on the N-term a Boc and on the C-term a NH2. In order to enter correctly you should first enter the sequence AAL and then explode the sequence. You may then change the N-term and C-term. Coordinate covalent bond It can be useful to denote to have special bond types between metal and ligands in metal complexes. Our editor can deal with that. Drawing metal complexes​ The chemical structure editor (openchemlib) allows drawing coordinative covalent bonds. In order to draw a 'zero order' bond you need to first draw a single bond between an atom and a metal. With the single bond drawing tool selected you can then click on the bond couple of times in order to get the dotted bond. The molecular formula will be calculated automatically, and we consider, for this example, 3 different molecules. Groups Often it is more convenient to denote protective groups with Boc or amino acids with their three-letter code. Our editor understands this. Molecular formula: using groups​ While the molecular formula is calculated automatically from the chemical structure it is sometimes useful to directly edit the molecular formula. In the editor you are allowed to use groups like Ala, Me, ... The full list of allowed groups can be seen by clicking on the little grid icon. Editing the molecular formula (salts, isotopes) You can also directly edit the molecular formula, for example to indicate salts. Information about molecular formula​ While the molecular formula is calculated automatically from the chemical structure it is sometimes useful to directly edit the molecular formula. When you enter the molecular formula you may use the '.' to separate salt and also add charges in each part of the molecule. You will see an information about the molecular weight and monoisotopic mass of all the parts of the molecule in the Molecular formula information box This can also be useful to indicate isotopes. Molecular formula: isotopes​ While the molecular formula is calculated automatically from the chemical structure it is sometimes useful to directly edit the molecular formula. Isotopes have to be entered between square brackets like [13C]. There is one exception, D that is a synonym of [2H]. There is also the possibility to enter non-natural isotopic ratio. In this case the ratio between all the stable isotopes will be placed between curly brackets and separated by a comma. This is, if you have a molecule with 10 carbons having 20% [12C] and 80% [13C] you will enter C{20,80}10. You can also use parenthesis in your molecular formula. Molecular formula: parenthesis​ While the molecular formula is calculated automatically from the chemical structure it is sometimes useful to directly edit the molecular formula. The mass editor allows using as many parenthesis levels as you want. Dealing with modified peptide or nucleotide sequence You might need to deal with modifications at the terminal positions of your peptides. Deal with modified peptide or nucleotide sequences​ Peptides, proteins and nucleotides may contain non-natural amino acids or nucleic bases. They may also have chain modifications at the terminal positions. This could be the result of post-translational modifications (PTM), synthesis using non-natural amino acids, etc. In order to deal with those cases the system allows entering sequences using one-letter code and all the modifications in parentheses either at a terminal position or directly after the residue. Everything that is in parentheses will stay untouched and if a terminal position contains a parenthesis it will not be modified. Examples: Peptidic sequence AAA(NH2) = HAlaAlaAlaNH2 (Me)C(S-1Se)(NH2) = Selenocysteine with N-terminal methylated and C-terminal amide Nucleic sequence AA(C6H11O) = AA(C6H11O) : A dinucleotide on a glucose Printing reports and barcodes It can be handy to print out an overview table of all information about a sample, including a barcode. Print report and get barcode​ It is possible to print the report from any tab. You should simply click on the Print icon that is present in the description. This will produce a report that contains barcode that represent this specific sample. Modifying access rights You might need to give some colleague access to your sample, for example, to upload a characterization. Sample rights​ This view allows to manage the rights of samples: add a specific user (email address) add a specific group remove a specific user (email address) remove a specific group In order to proceed you should first select a list of samples to which the modification applies. There are 2 ways to select sample. The first is by clicking on the 'plus' symbol present on the right of the sample line. The second is by selecting some samples from the list and then clicking on the 'plus' symbol present on the top of the window. Once sample have been selected you can either Add or Delete a right by clicking on the corresponding button and entering an owner. An owner is either: a specific user (the email address of the user) and adding a specific user will provide READ and WRITE access to the sample a specific group as defined by the administrators and managed by 'ROC'. You should contact your administrator to either create a new group or add / remove users from the group. A group may have read/write access or read only access. Structure history Our editor remembers the last 20 structures and allows you to start a new molecule drawing from a previous one. Reload previous structures in the molecule editor​ The structure editor remembers the last 20 edited structures. If you want to start your new molecule from a previous one you may simply click on the history icon.

Spectra selection All the spectra analysis tools start with a phase of selection. Select samples​ In order to facilitate the analysis of the spectra it is advised to have samples containing representative spectra in order to evaluate the intra-variability as well as the reproducibility. Selection of spectra to analyze is achieved with one of those 3 methods: At the level of the sample by either clicking on the +, this will add all the spectra related to this sample or on the + on the top of the sample box to add all the spectra of all the selected samples. If you select a sample it is also possible to add a specific spectrum by clicking on the + at the level of the spectra list. Once spectra have been selected, data normalization filters can be applied : Normalization How to normalize spectra. Preprocessing In order to compare spectra it is required to create a matrix. In this matrix each row corresponds to a spectrum while the columns are the various values for a specific X. To create this matrix we apply various preprocessing methods that consist of: filter the data in order to reduce the impact of sample preparation or experimental artifacts using various filters select the representative part of the spectra that is expected to be important for the analysis remove large peaks not characteristic to the sample (like water in NMR spectra) that could interfere with the analysis reduce the number of points in order to accelerate the analysis apply matrix related processing allowing to normalize the columns Filters​ You may also apply various Filters that allows to normalize or transform the data. Among those filters we have: Center mean Divide by SD (standard deviation) Rescale: set the min value to 0 and the max value to 1 Normalize: set the sum of all the points to 1 Align: create a peak picking between from / to and calculate the mean X value between the nbPeaks highest peaks. The spectrum will be moved so that the mean has the targetX value. Pareto: Pareto scaling, which uses the square root of standard deviation as the scaling factor, circumvents the amplification of noise by retaining a small portion of magnitude information. 10.1016/j.molstruc.2007.12.026 Savitzky-golay: smoothing spectra and calculate derivatives based on the following parameters: windowSize: smoothing window, must be an odd number derivative: enter 0, 1 or 2 polynomial: the degree of the polynomial used to calculate SG X function: a function that modifies the X axis based on the x parameter. Like for example log(x) Y function: a function that modifies the Y axis based on the y parameter. Like for example log10(y+1) One classical preprocessing algorithm is Standard Normal Variate (SNV). This preprocessing can be achieved by selecting the 2 options Center mean and Divide by SD. Selecting the range​ Only the information between the From and To values of the range will be considered. Exclusions​ Depending on the analysis some region should be removed in order to improve the analysis. For example NMR spectroscopy in water yields to a large peak around 4.5ppm and using exclusion zone it can be removed from the analysis. Number of points​ The data normalization process will select equidistant Nb points between the From and To values. Matrix processing​ Once all the previous filters have been applied we obtain a matrix in which rows represent the normalized spectra and columns represent the intensity of teach spectrum. Some filters are using the columns for further processing like: PQN: Probabilistic Quotient Normalization (10.1021/ac051632c) Center mean: for each column the mean of the values will be centered Rescale (0 to 1): for each column the min value will be set to 0 and the max value to 1 Large dataset​ The list of the spectra in the dataset is displayed in the following table: In some cases it is not possible to keep in memory the original spectra and the system will only keep the normalized spectra.

For example the unit type will store in the database the value using as units SI (we convert the data to the units defined by the 'standard international') and specify in which units the user would like to display the data. So in the following example we are in fact storing the value -150°C by storing the value in SI (Kelvin) and specifying that the user wants to see it in °C. { \"SI\": 123.15, \"unit\": \"°C\"} Copy Another example is the valueUnits type that will store the data in 2 different properties (value and unit). In this case the value is stored in the specified units and there is no conversions. { \"value\": 123, \"units\": \"°C\"} Copy While this way to store the data in the database is very practical it is not the way that the user would like to see his results. We have therefore the possibility to forceType: define how the user would like to see the results. Other types include mf.

Spectra selection All the spectra analysis tools start with a phase of selection. Select samples​ In order to facilitate the analysis of the spectra it is advised to have samples containing representative spectra in order to evaluate the intra-variability as well as the reproducibility. Selection of spectra to analyze is achieved with one of those 3 methods: At the level of the sample by either clicking on the +, this will add all the spectra related to this sample or on the + on the top of the sample box to add all the spectra of all the selected samples. If you select a sample it is also possible to add a specific spectrum by clicking on the + at the level of the spectra list. Once spectra have been selected, data normalization filters can be applied : Normalization How to normalize spectra. Preprocessing In order to compare spectra it is required to create a matrix. In this matrix each row corresponds to a spectrum while the columns are the various values for a specific X. To create this matrix we apply various preprocessing methods that consist of: filter the data in order to reduce the impact of sample preparation or experimental artifacts using various filters select the representative part of the spectra that is expected to be important for the analysis remove large peaks not characteristic to the sample (like water in NMR spectra) that could interfere with the analysis reduce the number of points in order to accelerate the analysis apply matrix related processing allowing to normalize the columns Filters​ You may also apply various Filters that allows to normalize or transform the data. Among those filters we have: Center mean Divide by SD (standard deviation) Rescale: set the min value to 0 and the max value to 1 Normalize: set the sum of all the points to 1 Align: create a peak picking between from / to and calculate the mean X value between the nbPeaks highest peaks. The spectrum will be moved so that the mean has the targetX value. Pareto: Pareto scaling, which uses the square root of standard deviation as the scaling factor, circumvents the amplification of noise by retaining a small portion of magnitude information. 10.1016/j.molstruc.2007.12.026 Savitzky-golay: smoothing spectra and calculate derivatives based on the following parameters: windowSize: smoothing window, must be an odd number derivative: enter 0, 1 or 2 polynomial: the degree of the polynomial used to calculate SG X function: a function that modifies the X axis based on the x parameter. Like for example log(x) Y function: a function that modifies the Y axis based on the y parameter. Like for example log10(y+1) One classical preprocessing algorithm is Standard Normal Variate (SNV). This preprocessing can be achieved by selecting the 2 options Center mean and Divide by SD. Selecting the range​ Only the information between the From and To values of the range will be considered. Exclusions​ Depending on the analysis some region should be removed in order to improve the analysis. For example NMR spectroscopy in water yields to a large peak around 4.5ppm and using exclusion zone it can be removed from the analysis. Number of points​ The data normalization process will select equidistant Nb points between the From and To values. Matrix processing​ Once all the previous filters have been applied we obtain a matrix in which rows represent the normalized spectra and columns represent the intensity of teach spectrum. Some filters are using the columns for further processing like: PQN: Probabilistic Quotient Normalization (10.1021/ac051632c) Center mean: for each column the mean of the values will be centered Rescale (0 to 1): for each column the min value will be set to 0 and the max value to 1 Large dataset​ The list of the spectra in the dataset is displayed in the following table: In some cases it is not possible to keep in memory the original spectra and the system will only keep the normalized spectra. Therefore, it will not be possible to change the normalization parameters anymore. Preview​ A preview of the normalized spectra as well as the exclusions zones will be displayed. This allows to fine tune the processing. The superimposed spectra can be manipulated without numerous advanced features described here. The superimposed spectra can be manipulated without numerous : Visualization How to visualize spectra.

By default, the sample reference Select all spectra Append to selected spectra Select only current spectra Remove spectra from current selection Unselect all spectra Graph options​ It is possible to either display the selected spectra, all the spectra or various derived information. Customization of the display is achieved using the chart toolbar: Display spectra​ The first options allow to either display all the spectra, only the selected spectra or nothing. Displaying no spectrum is useful when displaying other derived data. Original / normalized​ These options allow to either display the original spectra or the normalized data. Most of the time we will display normalized data. Those are the data that will be analyzed, and normally they also take less room in memory. Boxplot​ The boxplot kind of representation allows to display the first / third quartile as a dark grey zone for each X point. The min and max values are represented as a light gray zone and the median is represented as a line for which the color varies based on the standard deviation (red: high variation, blue: small variation). Tracking information​ By selecting the tracking information you will display the X values and the corresponding Y values for all the spectra. Correlation​ Correlation of the vector represented by the Y points can be useful to determine which peaks are correlated in a big mixture of products. This is known in NMR metabolomics as STOCSY.

The simulated spectrum, the chemical structure with explicit hydrogens and the list of peaks modules are linked, so that hovering over an entry in the list will highlight the corresponding atom in the structure and the relevant peak in the spectrum. NMR prediction is done with NMRshiftDB. It is an NMR database for organic structures and their spectra. Using this information, in conjunction with the principle of HOSE code, a machine learning model makes chemical shift predictions. HOSE What is the HOSE code. HOSE code​ The HOSE (Hierarchically Ordered Spherical Environment) code describes the environment of individual atoms spherically. The environment of a particular atom is described in the form of a string of characters. The priority rules and necessary syntax have been outlined in the original paper in 1978. For instance, here are some symbols. The prediction of the signal due to each individual atom is done by considering the chemical environment of the atom by layers like onion peels.

Spectra selection All the spectra analysis tools start with a phase of selection.

Selection of spectra to analyze is achieved with one of those 3 methods: At the level of the sample by either clicking on the +, this will add all the spectra related to this sample or on the + on the top of the sample box to add all the spectra of all the selected samples. If you select a sample it is also possible to add a specific spectrum by clicking on the + at the level of the spectra list. Once spectra have been selected, data normalization filters can be applied : Normalization How to normalize spectra. Preprocessing In order to compare spectra it is required to create a matrix. In this matrix each row corresponds to a spectrum while the columns are the various values for a specific X. To create this matrix we apply various preprocessing methods that consist of: filter the data in order to reduce the impact of sample preparation or experimental artifacts using various filters select the representative part of the spectra that is expected to be important for the analysis remove large peaks not characteristic to the sample (like water in NMR spectra) that could interfere with the analysis reduce the number of points in order to accelerate the analysis apply matrix related processing allowing to normalize the columns Filters​ You may also apply various Filters that allows to normalize or transform the data. Among those filters we have: Center mean Divide by SD (standard deviation) Rescale: set the min value to 0 and the max value to 1 Normalize: set the sum of all the points to 1 Align: create a peak picking between from / to and calculate the mean X value between the nbPeaks highest peaks. The spectrum will be moved so that the mean has the targetX value. Pareto: Pareto scaling, which uses the square root of standard deviation as the scaling factor, circumvents the amplification of noise by retaining a small portion of magnitude information. 10.1016/j.molstruc.2007.12.026 Savitzky-golay: smoothing spectra and calculate derivatives based on the following parameters: windowSize: smoothing window, must be an odd number derivative: enter 0, 1 or 2 polynomial: the degree of the polynomial used to calculate SG X function: a function that modifies the X axis based on the x parameter. Like for example log(x) Y function: a function that modifies the Y axis based on the y parameter. Like for example log10(y+1) One classical preprocessing algorithm is Standard Normal Variate (SNV). This preprocessing can be achieved by selecting the 2 options Center mean and Divide by SD. Selecting the range​ Only the information between the From and To values of the range will be considered. Exclusions​ Depending on the analysis some region should be removed in order to improve the analysis. For example NMR spectroscopy in water yields to a large peak around 4.5ppm and using exclusion zone it can be removed from the analysis. Number of points​ The data normalization process will select equidistant Nb points between the From and To values. Matrix processing​ Once all the previous filters have been applied we obtain a matrix in which rows represent the normalized spectra and columns represent the intensity of teach spectrum. Some filters are using the columns for further processing like: PQN: Probabilistic Quotient Normalization (10.1021/ac051632c) Center mean: for each column the mean of the values will be centered Rescale (0 to 1): for each column the min value will be set to 0 and the max value to 1 Large dataset​ The list of the spectra in the dataset is displayed in the following table: In some cases it is not possible to keep in memory the original spectra and the system will only keep the normalized spectra.

By default, the sample reference Select all spectra Append to selected spectra Select only current spectra Remove spectra from current selection Unselect all spectra Graph options​ It is possible to either display the selected spectra, all the spectra or various derived information. Customization of the display is achieved using the chart toolbar: Display spectra​ The first options allow to either display all the spectra, only the selected spectra or nothing. Displaying no spectrum is useful when displaying other derived data. Original / normalized​ These options allow to either display the original spectra or the normalized data. Most of the time we will display normalized data. Those are the data that will be analyzed, and normally they also take less room in memory. Boxplot​ The boxplot kind of representation allows to display the first / third quartile as a dark grey zone for each X point. The min and max values are represented as a light gray zone and the median is represented as a line for which the color varies based on the standard deviation (red: high variation, blue: small variation). Tracking information​ By selecting the tracking information you will display the X values and the corresponding Y values for all the spectra. Correlation​ Correlation of the vector represented by the Y points can be useful to determine which peaks are correlated in a big mixture of products. This is known in NMR metabolomics as STOCSY.

Spectra selection All the spectra analysis tools start with a phase of selection. Select samples​ In order to facilitate the analysis of the spectra it is advised to have samples containing representative spectra in order to evaluate the intra-variability as well as the reproducibility. Selection of spectra to analyze is achieved with one of those 3 methods: At the level of the sample by either clicking on the +, this will add all the spectra related to this sample or on the + on the top of the sample box to add all the spectra of all the selected samples. If you select a sample it is also possible to add a specific spectrum by clicking on the + at the level of the spectra list. Once spectra have been selected, data normalization filters can be applied : Normalization How to normalize spectra. Preprocessing In order to compare spectra it is required to create a matrix. In this matrix each row corresponds to a spectrum while the columns are the various values for a specific X. To create this matrix we apply various preprocessing methods that consist of: filter the data in order to reduce the impact of sample preparation or experimental artifacts using various filters select the representative part of the spectra that is expected to be important for the analysis remove large peaks not characteristic to the sample (like water in NMR spectra) that could interfere with the analysis reduce the number of points in order to accelerate the analysis apply matrix related processing allowing to normalize the columns Filters​ You may also apply various Filters that allows to normalize or transform the data. Among those filters we have: Center mean Divide by SD (standard deviation) Rescale: set the min value to 0 and the max value to 1 Normalize: set the sum of all the points to 1 Align: create a peak picking between from / to and calculate the mean X value between the nbPeaks highest peaks. The spectrum will be moved so that the mean has the targetX value. Pareto: Pareto scaling, which uses the square root of standard deviation as the scaling factor, circumvents the amplification of noise by retaining a small portion of magnitude information. 10.1016/j.molstruc.2007.12.026 Savitzky-golay: smoothing spectra and calculate derivatives based on the following parameters: windowSize: smoothing window, must be an odd number derivative: enter 0, 1 or 2 polynomial: the degree of the polynomial used to calculate SG X function: a function that modifies the X axis based on the x parameter. Like for example log(x) Y function: a function that modifies the Y axis based on the y parameter. Like for example log10(y+1) One classical preprocessing algorithm is Standard Normal Variate (SNV). This preprocessing can be achieved by selecting the 2 options Center mean and Divide by SD. Selecting the range​ Only the information between the From and To values of the range will be considered. Exclusions​ Depending on the analysis some region should be removed in order to improve the analysis. For example NMR spectroscopy in water yields to a large peak around 4.5ppm and using exclusion zone it can be removed from the analysis. Number of points​ The data normalization process will select equidistant Nb points between the From and To values. Matrix processing​ Once all the previous filters have been applied we obtain a matrix in which rows represent the normalized spectra and columns represent the intensity of teach spectrum. Some filters are using the columns for further processing like: PQN: Probabilistic Quotient Normalization (10.1021/ac051632c) Center mean: for each column the mean of the values will be centered Rescale (0 to 1): for each column the min value will be set to 0 and the max value to 1 Large dataset​ The list of the spectra in the dataset is displayed in the following table: In some cases it is not possible to keep in memory the original spectra and the system will only keep the normalized spectra. Therefore, it will not be possible to change the normalization parameters anymore. Preview​ A preview of the normalized spectra as well as the exclusions zones will be displayed. This allows to fine tune the processing. The superimposed spectra can be manipulated without numerous advanced features described here. The superimposed spectra can be manipulated without numerous : Visualization How to visualize spectra. Spectra visualization Numerous options are available to display the either all the spectra in the dataset or the selected spectra in the dataset.

By default, the sample reference Select all spectra Append to selected spectra Select only current spectra Remove spectra from current selection Unselect all spectra Graph options​ It is possible to either display the selected spectra, all the spectra or various derived information. Customization of the display is achieved using the chart toolbar: Display spectra​ The first options allow to either display all the spectra, only the selected spectra or nothing. Displaying no spectrum is useful when displaying other derived data. Original / normalized​ These options allow to either display the original spectra or the normalized data. Most of the time we will display normalized data. Those are the data that will be analyzed, and normally they also take less room in memory. Boxplot​ The boxplot kind of representation allows to display the first / third quartile as a dark grey zone for each X point. The min and max values are represented as a light gray zone and the median is represented as a line for which the color varies based on the standard deviation (red: high variation, blue: small variation). Tracking information​ By selecting the tracking information you will display the X values and the corresponding Y values for all the spectra. Correlation​ Correlation of the vector represented by the Y points can be useful to determine which peaks are correlated in a big mixture of products. This is known in NMR metabolomics as STOCSY.

You may also drop or paste a JCAMP file to superimpose an experimental spectrum over the prediction. JCAMP format How is a JCAMP file structured. JCAMP file format​ JCAMP-DX (Joint Committee on Atomic and Molecular Physical Data Exchange) is a standard file format for the exchange of spectra and related physical and chemical information between different spectrometers, databases or other systems. The information is stored using ASCII characters and the file can be viewed, corrected and annotated with a text editor. The spectra are stored as a table containing (x,y) coordinate pairs. Besides the data points, it is possible to store metainformation and make comments. The file extension is .jdx. A JCAMP document is composed of an unlimited number of Labelled Data Records (LDRs). Each LDR starts with a “##” and ends with “=”. Any space, comma, slash or hyphen is removed and the text is written with capital letters. Some examples of Data Labels: TITLE : title of the experiment END : the last line of the file XUNITS : the units reported on the x-axis NPOINTS : number of points Two important LDRs are “XYDATA” and “PEAKTABLE”, which contain the spectral information. The former gives information in the form of a table where the first value in a line stands for an x coordinate and any subsequent values are y-coordinates with an equidistant increment on the x-axis. The latter provides information as a collection of (X,Y) pairs. It is commonplace to compress the data tables. For instance, the table of numbers can be replaced by a line of characters (pseudo-digits). Among these pseudo-digits, there are PAC, SQZ, DIF, DIFDUP. An example of compressed data using DIFDUP An in depth description is given in the original paper by McDonald and Wilks. Insofar as JCAMP is a well-described and accessible format, it partially aligns with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles . It is interoperable and reusable. Provided that the user makes it findable and accessible, JCAMP will fully comply with the aforementioned principles. The simulated spectrum, the chemical structure with explicit hydrogens and the list of peaks modules are linked, so that hovering over an entry in the list will highlight the corresponding atom in the structure and the relevant peak in the spectrum. Furthermore, the predicted spectrum is reported in the publication ready form (with chemical shifts, scalar couplings and peak multiplicity). tip In the advanced options, you can adjust the parameters of the simulation. With frequency you can specify the strength of the magnetic field. Furthermore, you may adjust the range of chemical shifts in which to perform the simulation. Linewidth and number of points specify the peak width and the number of data points to simulate, respectively. 11","s":"1H prediction","u":"/docs/eln/uuid/eea0ba081ea2cc99da5c1aed2f29a0a8","h":"","p":1208},{"i":1211,"t":"JCAMP-DX (Joint Committee on Atomic and Molecular Physical Data Exchange) is a standard file format for the exchange of spectra and related physical and chemical information between different spectrometers, databases or other systems.

Use the up / down wedge bonds to indicate stereochemistry at the C4 centers. Remember, that only bonds with a \"sharp point\" towards the atom are considered. When creating SMILES the editor tries to guess missing stereo features, in unresolvable cases an error message is issued and the SMILES without stereo information is created. When the \"autoez\" option is set, SMILES with E,Z stereochemistry on all non-ring double bonds will be generated automatically. Without this keyword (or for ring double bonds) you have to mark a double bond as stereo by clicking on it with the stereo bond button selected. The bond color will change to magenta. Stereochemistry may be completely disabled by the \"nostereo\" option. Atom Numbering​ Atom numbering (marking) is enabled by the option \"number\" (for reaction input this is default). Button appears in the menu. To mark an atom the \"numbering mode\" must be on, selected by clicking the 123 button. The atom number is chosen by pressing respective keys on your keyboard (i.e. 2 or 12); then atom(s) must be clicked. To delete the number pres 0 at your keyboard and then click the atom. Input of Multipart Structures​ By default only non-disconnected structures may be entered. This may be changed by a \"multipart\" option. A button appears in the menu. A new molecule may be started only after clicking this button, then selecting a proper template (atom, ring or bond) and clicking free space in the drawing area. Without clicking the NEW button first clicking the free space has the same effect as in the standard mode (i.e moving or rotation of the last touched molecule). In the multipart mode the button deletes the last touched molecule. Reaction Input​ Reaction input is enabled with the option \"reaction\". Buttons , and appear in the menu and arrow appears also in the drawing area. Now simply draw reactant(s), product(s) and modulator(s) (modulators have to be above the arrow) as explained in the description of input of multipart structures. The arrow button enables simplified input of reactions. After clicking it, the reactant will be copied to the product (including atom numbering, if any). Query Features​ Query button (when enabled in the options) launches a query window that allows creation of SMARTS atom or bond queries by combining various atom attributes. Select the SMARTS options in this panel and then click the respective atom or bond in the molecule.

Use the up / down wedge bonds to indicate stereochemistry at the C4 centers. Remember, that only bonds with a \"sharp point\" towards the atom are considered. When creating SMILES the editor tries to guess missing stereo features, in unresolvable cases an error message is issued and the SMILES without stereo information is created. When the \"autoez\" option is set, SMILES with E,Z stereochemistry on all non-ring double bonds will be generated automatically. Without this keyword (or for ring double bonds) you have to mark a double bond as stereo by clicking on it with the stereo bond button selected. The bond color will change to magenta. Stereochemistry may be completely disabled by the \"nostereo\" option. Atom Numbering​ Atom numbering (marking) is enabled by the option \"number\" (for reaction input this is default). Button appears in the menu. To mark an atom the \"numbering mode\" must be on, selected by clicking the 123 button. The atom number is chosen by pressing respective keys on your keyboard (i.e. 2 or 12); then atom(s) must be clicked. To delete the number pres 0 at your keyboard and then click the atom. Input of Multipart Structures​ By default only non-disconnected structures may be entered. This may be changed by a \"multipart\" option. A button appears in the menu. A new molecule may be started only after clicking this button, then selecting a proper template (atom, ring or bond) and clicking free space in the drawing area. Without clicking the NEW button first clicking the free space has the same effect as in the standard mode (i.e moving or rotation of the last touched molecule). In the multipart mode the button deletes the last touched molecule. Reaction Input​ Reaction input is enabled with the option \"reaction\". Buttons , and appear in the menu and arrow appears also in the drawing area. Now simply draw reactant(s), product(s) and modulator(s) (modulators have to be above the arrow) as explained in the description of input of multipart structures. The arrow button enables simplified input of reactions. After clicking it, the reactant will be copied to the product (including atom numbering, if any). Query Features​ Query button (when enabled in the options) launches a query window that allows creation of SMARTS atom or bond queries by combining various atom attributes. Select the SMARTS options in this panel and then click the respective atom or bond in the molecule. Copy and Paste​ Right mouse click opens the Copy and Paste pop-up menu that allows to copy the molecule as SMILES or MOL file or paste MOL , SDF, or RXN files into the editor. On supported touch devices, the menu can be opened by �touch and hold� on the surface of the editor. Keyboard shortcuts Ctrl C (for copy) and Ctrl V (for paste) are supported on most browsers. Drag and Drop of Files in the Editor​ Some HTML 5 compatible browsers support the drag and drop of files. Starting with version 2013-03-24, JSME accepts dropping of text files in the format MOL, SDF and RXN. To drag molecule from the editor into the appropriate destination (for example Word or text document, or desktop) drag the icon in the lower right corner of the editor.","s":"JSME Help and Basic Instructions","u":"/docs/eln/uuid/jsme","h":"#jsme-help-and-basic-instructions","p":1269},{"i":1275,"t":"README Normalization How to normalize spectra. Preprocessing In order to compare spectra it is required to create a matrix. In this matrix each row corresponds to a spectrum while the columns are the various values for a specific X. To create this matrix we apply various preprocessing methods that consist of: filter the data in order to reduce the impact of sample preparation or experimental artifacts using various filters select the representative part of the spectra that is expected to be important for the analysis remove large peaks not characteristic to the sample (like water in NMR spectra) that could interfere with the analysis reduce the number of points in order to accelerate the analysis apply matrix related processing allowing to normalize the columns Filters​ You may also apply various Filters that allows to normalize or transform the data. Among those filters we have: Center mean Divide by SD (standard deviation) Rescale: set the min value to 0 and the max value to 1 Normalize: set the sum of all the points to 1 Align: create a peak picking between from / to and calculate the mean X value between the nbPeaks highest peaks. The spectrum will be moved so that the mean has the targetX value. Pareto: Pareto scaling, which uses the square root of standard deviation as the scaling factor, circumvents the amplification of noise by retaining a small portion of magnitude information. 10.1016/j.molstruc.2007.12.026 Savitzky-golay: smoothing spectra and calculate derivatives based on the following parameters: windowSize: smoothing window, must be an odd number derivative: enter 0, 1 or 2 polynomial: the degree of the polynomial used to calculate SG X function: a function that modifies the X axis based on the x parameter. Like for example log(x) Y function: a function that modifies the Y axis based on the y parameter. Like for example log10(y+1) One classical preprocessing algorithm is Standard Normal Variate (SNV). This preprocessing can be achieved by selecting the 2 options Center mean and Divide by SD. Selecting the range​ Only the information between the From and To values of the range will be considered. Exclusions​ Depending on the analysis some region should be removed in order to improve the analysis. For example NMR spectroscopy in water yields to a large peak around 4.5ppm and using exclusion zone it can be removed from the analysis. Number of points​ The data normalization process will select equidistant Nb points between the From and To values. Matrix processing​ Once all the previous filters have been applied we obtain a matrix in which rows represent the normalized spectra and columns represent the intensity of teach spectrum. Some filters are using the columns for further processing like: PQN: Probabilistic Quotient Normalization (10.1021/ac051632c) Center mean: for each column the mean of the values will be centered Rescale (0 to 1): for each column the min value will be set to 0 and the max value to 1 Large dataset​ The list of the spectra in the dataset is displayed in the following table: In some cases it is not possible to keep in memory the original spectra and the system will only keep the normalized spectra.

Thus, the atom mapping tool is only available, when a reaction is edited. Query feature dialogs only open, when a substructure is edited, etc. Atom and Bond Hot-Keys​ Hot-keys allow to quickly change atom and bond types. When the mouse is moved over an atom or bond then the atom or bond is automatically highlighted, indicating that mouse clicks or pressing a hot-key affect the highlighted object. Hot-Key Type Name Explanation 'Delete' Atoms Bonds Mapping Delete Deletes highlighted and selected atoms and bonds. When a reaction is edited and the mapping tool is selected, then pressing the 'Delete' key removes all atom mapping from the reaction. '1','2','3', ... Atom Atom Chain Attaches a chain of 'n' carbon atoms to the highlighted atom provided that its valence maximum is not exceeded. 'a','b','c', ... Atom Atom Symbol Changes the symbol of the highlighted atom according to the typed sequence of atoms. E.g. typing 'n' followed by 'a' converts the atom to a sodium atom. '+', '-' Atom Charge Modifiers Increases or decreases the charge of the highlighted atom. '?' Atom Connection Point Converts an atom into a connection point of a substituent or building block. 'q' Atom, Bond Query Feature Dialog If a substructure query is edited then this key opens a query feature dialog, which allows to specify additional atom/bond conditions for the substructure search. '1','2','3' Bond Bond Order Changes the highlighted bond into a single, double or triple bond. 'u' Bond Up Bond Changes the highlighted bond into 'up' stereo bond, if at least one of the associated atoms is a relative or absolute stereo center. 'd' Bond Down Bond Changes the highlighted bond into 'down' stereo bond, if at least one of the associated atoms is a relative or absolute stereo center. 'c' Bond Cross Bond Changes the highlighted bond into a double bond with unknown configuration. '4','5','6','7' Bond Annelate Ring Annellates a new saturated ring with the respective ring size to the highlighted bond. 'b' Bond Annelate Benzo Annellates a new benzene ring to the highlighted bond. Buttons and Tools​ Chemical structures are drawn by selecting an appropriate tool and applying it while moving, clicking and dragging the mouse pointer over the drawing area. While the selection of a tool has no immidiate effect on the drawn structure, pressing a button does. Currently available buttons allow to clean up atom coordinates or to revert the most recent structure change. Button or Tool Name Explanation Atom Tools The Atom Tools cover atoms frequently used in organic chemistry. After selecting one of these tools, you may place new atoms by clicking into the empty space or change existing atom by clicking onto them. Atom Detail Tool Double clicking an atom with this tool selected will open a dialog window for specifying an unusual atom label, specific isotop, abnormal valence and/or radical state. When closing the dialog the double clicked atom is changed accordingly. The dialog settings are remembered applied to any other clicked atom, as long as the tool is selected. Charge Tools These tools let you assign charges to atoms. Multiple clicks on the same atom will increase or decrease the charge by 1. The Osiris Structure Editor assumes the presence of implicit hydrogens at any charged or non charged atoms to meet the atom's default valence. However, implicit hydrogens are only shown on hetero atoms. Ring Tools After selecting one of the predefined rings, one may create a new ring or attach a ring to an existing bond or atom to create annelated ring systems or a spiro compound, respectively. Bond Tools Bond Tools allow you to create new bonds and to change existing bonds concerning their order or stereo-orientation. By clicking into the open space you create a new bond of the selected type including two carbon atoms. Clicking onto an existing atom will attach a new carbon. Dragging the mouse from one atom to another one will just connect these atoms or increment the bond order between them, if they were already connected. If the plain single bond tool is selected, bonds may be multiply clicked to cycle through the possible bond orders. Where reasonable, it also toggles between double bonds with known or unknown configuration, the so-called cross bond. When using stereo bonds please consider that the pointed tip of the bond should always point to the stereo center. Chain Tool The Chain Tool provides the fastest way to draw aliphatic carbon chains in zig-zag orientation. With the selected Chain Tool click into the empty space or at an existing atom and drag the mouse to create a new zig-zag chain and flip its orientation. ESR Tools The editor supports the enhanced stereo recognition (ESR) introduced by Molecular Design Ltd. with IsisDraw V2.5. The ESR Tools allow to define for every stereo center, whether it is an absolute one or if it belongs to a group of stereo centers that have the drawn, but relative configuration. For any group of relative stereo centers one may define that the drawn and the inverse configurations are present, i.e. that we have a racemic situation concerning the group members. This is indicated by green stereo bonds and an ampersand '&' at the stereo centers. Likewise one may define groups of relative stereo centers that contain either the drawn configuration or the opposite one. Stereo centers of such a group are indicated by blue stereo bonds and the word 'or' at the stereo centers. In addition to the '&' or 'or' indicators group numbers show which stereo centers belong to the same group. Unknown Configuration Tool This symbol is used to denote an unknown stereo configuration at a chiral center. Cleanup Button A cleanup will generate new coordinates of an existing molecule. It rearranges bond and atom positions in order to have a proper 2D structure. If a part of the molecule or reaction is selected, the cleanup will retain the relative orientation of the non-selected atoms. Lasso Pointer Tool This tools allows you to select multiple atoms and bonds to rearrange, rotate, resize, delete or duplicate at the same time. Just drag the mouse pointer around the atoms of interest. Selected atoms and bonds are shown in red. By pressing the control key you switch to the rectangular selection mode and the SHIFT ⇧ key lets you add atoms to the current selection. By clicking onto an atom or bonds and dragging the mouse one may more it or all selected atoms, if the clicked one is selected. When pressing the SHIFT ⇧ key while dragging a selected fragment, an automatically created copy of the selected fragment is dragged. Where the editor needs to support multiple molecules, e.g. if a reaction is edited, then every reactant and product is indicated by a large light gray indicator in the background ('A', 'B', 'P1', etc.). Where independent fragments shall be treated as one molecule, e.g. anion and kation of one salt, one must locate those fragments close enough that there is only one indicator behind them. If a reaction or molecule query is edited, then one may double click an atom or a set of selected atoms to open a query feature dialog to specify additional conditions for a fragment to match in a substructure search. The same applies to individual or multiple selected bonds. If the edited object is not a query then double clicking of an atom or bond will just select the entire fragment. Delete Tool It allows you to delete individual atoms or bonds or selected parts of the molecule. Selected areas may also be removed by pressing the delete key from the keyboard. Zoom and Rotate Tool This tool allows to zoom or rotate the entire drawing or a selected subset. Just click at the intended origin for the rotation or zooming and drag the mouse vertically to zoom or horizontically to rotate. Mapping Tool This tool is only available when a reaction is edited. Use this tool to map reactant atoms to the respective product atoms. This is done by clicking on a reactant atom and dragging the mouse onto the corresponding product atom. The editor will acknowledge the link by displaying a red mapping number at both atoms. Afterwards it tries to map atoms in the vicinity automatically and displays green numbers at automatically mapped atoms. Please assign manually as many reactant-product pairs as are needed that the entire reaction is mapped completely and correctly. Pressing the 'Delete' key while this tool is selected removes all mapping from the reaction. Text Tool The text tool may only be selected in certain situations. If it is selected one may use it to place text elements directly into the drawing. These text elements will be integral part of the drawing and, thus, move, resize and rotate with the molecules or reaction.","s":"OpenChemLib Chemical Editor Concepts","u":"/docs/eln/uuid/ocl-editor","h":"#openchemlib-chemical-editor-concepts","p":1313},{"i":1318,"t":"In openchemlib editor it is possible to specify radicals.
