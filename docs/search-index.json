Once selected you can move this molecule (just click around and drag the mouse). Molecule selection Even if the molecule does not appear as being selected you can still act on it. In instance, you can: copy to the molecule to the other side of the reaction by clicking on the arrow. click on the white rectangle to delete this selected molecule. JSME editor If you would like to draw efficiently the molecules directly in the editor click on the little question mark and try to learn all the shortcuts. JSME JSME Help and Basic Instructions​ JSME Menu​ shows molecule SMILES clears the editing area (or the current molecule, if structure contains several parts) starts new molecule component (when multipart option or reaction input are enabled) delete mode (click on atom or bond to delete it) deletes functional group - choose this option and then click bond connecting the group with the main skeleton starts atom numbering or reaction mapping (when this option is enabled) query atom / SMARTS (when this option is enabled) switches between allowed charged states on clicked atom reaction input (when reactions are enabled) undo redo next ring will be added as a spiro ring version information and link to the help page input stereo bond, click existing stereo bond to cycle through possible types (up, dowm, orientation) powerful chain tool, allows creation of various chains and rings; click single bond to change it to double allows input of inorganic atoms or atoms in nonstandard valence state (in this case enter the atom symbol enclosed in [], for example the carbene carbon will be [C]) opens functional group popup menu move selected atom useful when drawing crowded structures (visible when enabled in options) Basic Editing​ Rings are added connected by a single bond (when not added to a terminal atom); if you want to add a spiro ring press SHIFT ⇧ when adding it. An alternative way to add a spiro ring (that may be used also on touch devices) is to press the icon; the next ring will be then added as spiro. With single bond selected, a click on existing single bond changes it to double. With the powerful chain tool you can draw chains, saturated rings and by clicking on single bond change it to a double bond. Molecule may be moved by \"dragging\" free space and rotated by pressing also the SHIFT ⇧ key. JSME Keyboard Shortcuts​ If you are using JSME often, learn the following shortcuts. They will speed-up your editing considerably. ESC returns to the standard editing state (carbon, single bond) d or Del starts delete mode atoms C, N, O, P, S, F, L (for Cl), B (for Br), I, H, R bonds - for single bond, = for double bond rings 3..8 for 3 to 8 membered rings, 1 for phenyl and 0 for furyl groups a - COOH, y - NO2, z - SO3H, t - tert. butyl, ft - CF3 Stereochemistry​ Stereochemistry at C4 centers, double bonds and allenes is supported. Use the up / down wedge bonds to indicate stereochemistry at the C4 centers. Remember, that only bonds with a \"sharp point\" towards the atom are considered. When creating SMILES the editor tries to guess missing stereo features, in unresolvable cases an error message is issued and the SMILES without stereo information is created. When the \"autoez\" option is set, SMILES with E,Z stereochemistry on all non-ring double bonds will be generated automatically. Without this keyword (or for ring double bonds) you have to mark a double bond as stereo by clicking on it with the stereo bond button selected. The bond color will change to magenta. Stereochemistry may be completely disabled by the \"nostereo\" option. Atom Numbering​ Atom numbering (marking) is enabled by the option \"number\" (for reaction input this is default). Button appears in the menu. To mark an atom the \"numbering mode\" must be on, selected by clicking the 123 button. The atom number is chosen by pressing respective keys on your keyboard (i.e. 2 or 12); then atom(s) must be clicked. To delete the number pres 0 at your keyboard and then click the atom. Input of Multipart Structures​ By default only non-disconnected structures may be entered. This may be changed by a \"multipart\" option. A button appears in the menu. A new molecule may be started only after clicking this button, then selecting a proper template (atom, ring or bond) and clicking free space in the drawing area. Without clicking the NEW button first clicking the free space has the same effect as in the standard mode (i.e moving or rotation of the last touched molecule). In the multipart mode the button deletes the last touched molecule. Reaction Input​ Reaction input is enabled with the option \"reaction\". Buttons , and appear in the menu and arrow appears also in the drawing area. Now simply draw reactant(s), product(s) and modulator(s) (modulators have to be above the arrow) as explained in the description of input of multipart structures. The arrow button enables simplified input of reactions. After clicking it, the reactant will be copied to the product (including atom numbering, if any). Query Features​ Query button (when enabled in the options) launches a query window that allows creation of SMARTS atom or bond queries by combining various atom attributes. Select the SMARTS options in this panel and then click the respective atom or bond in the molecule. Copy and Paste​ Right mouse click opens the Copy and Paste pop-up menu that allows to copy the molecule as SMILES or MOL file or paste MOL , SDF, or RXN files into the editor. On supported touch devices, the menu can be opened by �touch and hold� on the surface of the editor. Keyboard shortcuts Ctrl C (for copy) and Ctrl V (for paste) are supported on most browsers.

Toxicity risk alerts are an indication that the drawn structure may be harmful concerning the risk category specified. However, risk alerts are by no means meant to be a fully reliable toxicity prediction. Nor should be concluded from the absence of risk alerts that a particular substance is completely free of any toxic effect. In order to assess the toxicity prediction’s reliability we ran a set of toxic compounds and a set of presumably non-toxic compounds through the prediction. The diagram below shows the results obtained by predicting all available structures of four subsets of the RTECS database. For example, all structures known to be mutagenic were run through the mutagenicity assessment. 86 % of these structures where found to bear a high or medium risk of being mutagenic. As a control set served a collection of traded drugs of which the mutagenicity risk assessment revealed only 12 % of potentially harmful compounds. The prediction process relies on a precomputed set of structural fragment that give rise to toxicity alerts in case they are encountered in the structure currently drawn. These fragment lists were created by rigorously shreddering all compounds of the RTECS database known to be active in a certain toxicity class (e.g. mutagenicity). During the shredding any molecule was first cut at every rotatable bonds leading to a set of core fragments. These in turn were used to reconstruct all possible bigger fragments being a substructure of the original molecule. Afterwards, a substructure search process determined the occurrence frequency of any fragment (core and constructed fragments) within all compounds of that toxicity class. It also determined these fragment’s frequencies within the structures of more than 3000 traded drugs. Based on the assumption that traded drugs are largely free of toxic effects, any fragment was considered a risk factor if it often occurred as substructure of harmful compounds but never or rarely in traded drugs.","s":"Toxicity risk assessment","u":"/docs/eln/includes/property_prediction/","h":"#toxicity-risk-assessment","p":150},{"i":154,"t":"The logP value of a compound, which is the logarithm of its partition coefficient between n-octanol and water log(coctanol/cwater), is a well established measure of the compound’s hydrophilicity. Low hydrophilicities and therefore high logP values cause poor absorption or permeation. It has been shown for compounds to have a reasonable probability of being well absorbed their logP value must not be greater than 5.0. The distribution of calculated logP values of more than 3000 drugs on the market underlines this fact (see diagram). Our in-house logP calculation method is implemented as increment system adding contributions of every atom based on its atom type. Alltogether the cLogP predicting engine distinguishes 368 atom types which are composed of various properties of the atom itself (atomic number and ring membership) as its direct neighbors (bond type, aromaticity state and encoded atomic no). More than 5000 compounds with experimentally determined logP values were used as training set to optimize the 369 contribution values associated with the atom types. The correlation plot (see diagram) shows calculated versus experimentally determined logP values of an independent test set of more than 5000 compounds being different from the training set.","s":"cLogP calculation","u":"/docs/eln/includes/property_prediction/","h":"#clogp-calculation","p":150},{"i":156,"t":"The aqueous solubility of a compound significantly affects its absorption and distribution characteristics. Typically, a low solubility goes along with a bad absorption and therefore the general aim is to avoid poorly soluble compounds. Our estimated logS value is a unit stripped logarithm (base 10) of the solubility measured in mol/liter. In the following diagram you can see that more than 80% of the drugs on the market have a (estimated) logS value greater than -4. Similar to our in-house logP calculation we assess the solubility via an increment system by adding atom contributions depending on their atom types. The atom types employed here differ slightly from the ones used for the cLogP estimation in that respect that the ring membership is not looked at. Still there are 271 distinguishable atom types describing the atom and its near surrounding. More than 2000 compounds with experimentally determined solubility values (25 degrees, pH=7.5) were used as training set to optimize the contribution values associated with the atom types. The correlation plot on the right shows calculated versus experimentally determined logS. You can see that the precision of the logS estimation is worse than the one for logP.

Our approach is based on a list of about 5300 distinct substructure fragments with associated druglikeness scores. The druglikeness is calculated with the following equation summing up score values of those fragments that are present in the molecule under investigation: The fragmentlist was created by shreddering 3300 traded drugs as well as 15000 commercially available chemicals (Fluka) yielding a complete list of all available fragments. As a restriction the shredder considered only rotatable bonds as cuttable. In addition the substitution modes of all fragment atoms were retained, i.e. fragment atoms that hadn’t been further subtituted in the original compounds were marked as such and atoms being part of a bond that was cut were marked as carrying a further substituent. This way fragment substitution patterns are included in the fragments. The occurence frequency of every one of the fragments was determined within the collection of traded drugs and within the supposedly non-drug-like collection of Fluka compounds. All fragments with an overall frequency above a certain threshold were inverse clustered in order to remove highly redundant fragments. For the remaining fragments the druglikeness score was determined as the logarithm of the quotent of frequencies in traded drugs versus Fluka chemicals. The subsequent diagram shows the distribution of druglikeness values calculated from 15000 Fluka compounds and from 3300 traded drugs. It shows that about 80% of the drugs have a positive druglikeness value whereas the big majority of Fluka chemicals accounts for the negative values. Thus, try to keep your compounds in the positive range… A positive value states that your molecule contains predominantly fragments which are frequently present in commercial drugs. What it doesn’t necessarily mean, though, is that these fragments are well balanced concerning other properties. For instance, a molecule may be composed of drug-like, but lipophilic fragments only.

It was providing the first substructure search engine on the internet in which you could draw, thanks to a java applet, a chemical structure. This first search engine was done using 4D search engine and at that time even the HTTP server had to be developed using direct access to a TCP library. In 2000, we have also published in a journal that disappeared in the meantime ... a way to share spectra directly on the internet. Later this search engine has been rewritten from scratch in Java and since 2005 research data from the institute of chemistry of the University of Lausanne were stored in a MySQL database. At the beginning it was only possible to store mass spectra, NMR spectra, infrared spectra, ultraviolet spectra, circular dichroism, x-ray structure and chromatography. All the data were converted before importation to the IUPAC supported format: JCAMP-DX. On first January 2008 over 10'000 samples were already created in this database. This project grew, and we quickly reached over 100'000 samples in the database. It was based on one big project that became difficult to maintain and to develop. Moreover, we wanted to have the same code in the browser and on the server and with the disappearance of Java applets it became impossible. In 2014 a group of 4 people (Norman Pellet, Michaël Zasso, Daniel Kostro and Luc Patiny) started to redesign the full system based on a modular approach. At that time JavaScript was becoming a 'real' language and advanced scientific application in the browser could be foreseen. This development has led to over 200 open-source scientific libraries widely used (over 100'000 downloads per week) and exhaustively tested. Those packages are present in the following GitHub organizations: https://github.com/cheminfo https://github.com/mljs https://github.com/image-js Up to now, over 60 developers that have contributed to those projects!

Spectra selection All the spectra analysis tools start with a phase of selection. Select samples​ In order to facilitate the analysis of the spectra it is advised to have samples containing representative spectra in order to evaluate the intra-variability as well as the reproducibility. Selection of spectra to analyze is achieved with one of those 3 methods: At the level of the sample by either clicking on the +, this will add all the spectra related to this sample or on the + on the top of the sample box to add all the spectra of all the selected samples. If you select a sample it is also possible to add a specific spectrum by clicking on the + at the level of the spectra list. Once spectra have been selected, data normalization filters can be applied : Spectrum preprocessing Apply mathematical tools to the spectra. Preprocessing​ Filters​ You can apply the following filters to the spectra to enhance the visualization. The modifications include the following: Center Mean : subtract the mean from every variable observation in the dataset, so that the new variable's mean is centered at 0. Center Median : subtract the median from every variable observation in the dataset, so that the new variable's median is centered at 0` Divide by SD : divide every variable observable in the dataset by the standard deviation yields a distribution with a standard deviation equal to 1. Normed: Specify a value in the value field and select the type of normalization: Sum to value: normalize the integral under the curve so that it sums to the specified value. Absolute sum to value: normalize the integral under the curve so that the absolute sum sums to the specified value. Max to value: normalize the maximum value to the specified value. Rescale (x to y) : rescale the graph such that the y-values fit between specified minimum and maximum values. First derivative : calculate the first derivative of the spectra. Second derivative : calculate the second derivative of the spectra. Third derivative : calculate the third derivative of the spectra. Savitzky-Golay : smooth the spectra and calculate derivatives based on the following parameters: Window: smoothing window size, must be an odd number, greater than 5. Derivative: derivative order. Polynomial: the degree of the polynomial used to calculate the Savitzky-Golay. AirPLS baseline : baseline correction using adaptive iterative reweighed penalized least squares algorithm. Iterative polynomial baseline : baseline correction using iterative polynomial fitting algorithm. Rolling average baseline : baseline correction using a rolling average. Rolling median baseline : baseline correction using a rolling median. Rolling ball baseline : baseline correction using a rolling ball. Ensure growing X values: ensure that the x-values are in increasing order. Function on X : apply a function to the x-values. For example, log(x). Function on Y : apply a function to the y-values. For example, log10(y+1). Calibrate X : calibrate the x-values with the parameters from, to, nbPeak and targetX. Pareto normalization : Pareto scaling, which uses the square root of standard deviation as the scaling factor, circumvents the amplification of noise by retaining a small portion of magnitude information. 10.1016/j.molstruc.2007.12.026 One classical preprocessing algorithm is Standard Normal Variate (SNV). This preprocessing can be achieved by selecting the 2 options Center mean and Divide by SD. Selecting the range​ A certain range of x-values can be selected to show only a part of the spectrum using Range. Exclusions​ Depending on the analysis, some regions should be removed using Exclusions in order to improve the visualization. Number of points​ Number of points can be changed to reduce the number of points in the spectra. The superimposed spectra can be manipulated without numerous : Visualization How to visualize spectra. Spectra visualization Numerous options are available to display the either all the spectra in the dataset or the selected spectra in the dataset. Selection of spectra in the dataset​ The toolbar on the top of the list of spectra in the dataset provides many options (from left to right): Remove all spectra from dataset Select category: select which property contains the category description Download normalized matrix Recolor spectra based on category: a different color will be applied for each category. By default, the sample reference Select all spectra Append to selected spectra Select only current spectra Remove spectra from current selection Unselect all spectra Graph options​ It is possible to either display the selected spectra, all the spectra or various derived information. Customization of the display is achieved using the chart toolbar: Display spectra​ The first options allow to either display all the spectra, only the selected spectra or nothing. Displaying no spectrum is useful when displaying other derived data. Original / normalized​ These options allow to either display the original spectra or the normalized data. Most of the time we will display normalized data. Those are the data that will be analyzed, and normally they also take less room in memory. Boxplot​ The boxplot kind of representation allows to display the first / third quartile as a dark grey zone for each X point. The min and max values are represented as a light gray zone and the median is represented as a line for which the color varies based on the standard deviation (red: high variation, blue: small variation). Tracking information​ By selecting the tracking information you will display the X values and the corresponding Y values for all the spectra. Correlation​ Correlation of the vector represented by the Y points can be useful to determine which peaks are correlated in a big mixture of products. This is known in NMR metabolomics as STOCSY. By SHIFT ⇧ + ALT + click you can select the X value for which you would like to check correlation.

It is used to determine content and purity of a sample and analyze molecular structure. The method is based on the Zeeman effect - the splitting of the spectral line in the presence of a static magnetic field. The nuclei under a static field are perturbed by a weak oscillating magnetic field near the resonant frequency of the nuclei. This produces a precession of the nuclear spins around the static magnetic field, which can be detected in the form of voltage induced in a coil. 1H and 13C are the most commonly used nuclei, however others are possible. The basic NMR experiment involves three sequential steps: Alignment (polarization) of the magnetic nuclear spins in a constant magnetic field (Zeeman effect) Perturbation of this alignment of the nuclear spins by a weak oscillating magnetic field, usually referred to as a radio-frequency (RF) pulse Detection of the NMR signal (free induction decay) in the form of oscillating voltage in the detection coil, due to the precession of the nuclear spins around the constant magnetic field The information about the frequency is given as the chemical shift (ppm) which is independent of the magnetic field.

Selection of spectra to analyze is achieved with one of those 3 methods: At the level of the sample by either clicking on the +, this will add all the spectra related to this sample or on the + on the top of the sample box to add all the spectra of all the selected samples. If you select a sample it is also possible to add a specific spectrum by clicking on the + at the level of the spectra list. Once spectra have been selected, data normalization filters can be applied : Spectrum preprocessing Apply mathematical tools to the spectra. Preprocessing​ Filters​ You can apply the following filters to the spectra to enhance the visualization. The modifications include the following: Center Mean : subtract the mean from every variable observation in the dataset, so that the new variable's mean is centered at 0. Center Median : subtract the median from every variable observation in the dataset, so that the new variable's median is centered at 0` Divide by SD : divide every variable observable in the dataset by the standard deviation yields a distribution with a standard deviation equal to 1. Normed: Specify a value in the value field and select the type of normalization: Sum to value: normalize the integral under the curve so that it sums to the specified value. Absolute sum to value: normalize the integral under the curve so that the absolute sum sums to the specified value. Max to value: normalize the maximum value to the specified value. Rescale (x to y) : rescale the graph such that the y-values fit between specified minimum and maximum values. First derivative : calculate the first derivative of the spectra. Second derivative : calculate the second derivative of the spectra. Third derivative : calculate the third derivative of the spectra. Savitzky-Golay : smooth the spectra and calculate derivatives based on the following parameters: Window: smoothing window size, must be an odd number, greater than 5. Derivative: derivative order. Polynomial: the degree of the polynomial used to calculate the Savitzky-Golay. AirPLS baseline : baseline correction using adaptive iterative reweighed penalized least squares algorithm. Iterative polynomial baseline : baseline correction using iterative polynomial fitting algorithm. Rolling average baseline : baseline correction using a rolling average. Rolling median baseline : baseline correction using a rolling median. Rolling ball baseline : baseline correction using a rolling ball. Ensure growing X values: ensure that the x-values are in increasing order. Function on X : apply a function to the x-values. For example, log(x). Function on Y : apply a function to the y-values. For example, log10(y+1). Calibrate X : calibrate the x-values with the parameters from, to, nbPeak and targetX. Pareto normalization : Pareto scaling, which uses the square root of standard deviation as the scaling factor, circumvents the amplification of noise by retaining a small portion of magnitude information. 10.1016/j.molstruc.2007.12.026 One classical preprocessing algorithm is Standard Normal Variate (SNV).

By default, the sample reference Select all spectra Append to selected spectra Select only current spectra Remove spectra from current selection Unselect all spectra Graph options​ It is possible to either display the selected spectra, all the spectra or various derived information. Customization of the display is achieved using the chart toolbar: Display spectra​ The first options allow to either display all the spectra, only the selected spectra or nothing. Displaying no spectrum is useful when displaying other derived data. Original / normalized​ These options allow to either display the original spectra or the normalized data. Most of the time we will display normalized data. Those are the data that will be analyzed, and normally they also take less room in memory. Boxplot​ The boxplot kind of representation allows to display the first / third quartile as a dark grey zone for each X point. The min and max values are represented as a light gray zone and the median is represented as a line for which the color varies based on the standard deviation (red: high variation, blue: small variation). Tracking information​ By selecting the tracking information you will display the X values and the corresponding Y values for all the spectra. Correlation​ Correlation of the vector represented by the Y points can be useful to determine which peaks are correlated in a big mixture of products. This is known in NMR metabolomics as STOCSY.

Ensure growing X values: ensure that the x-values are in increasing order. Function on X : apply a function to the x-values. For example, log(x). Function on Y : apply a function to the y-values. For example, log10(y+1). Calibrate X : calibrate the x-values with the parameters from, to, nbPeak and targetX. Pareto normalization : Pareto scaling, which uses the square root of standard deviation as the scaling factor, circumvents the amplification of noise by retaining a small portion of magnitude information. 10.1016/j.molstruc.2007.12.026 One classical preprocessing algorithm is Standard Normal Variate (SNV).

Use the up / down wedge bonds to indicate stereochemistry at the C4 centers. Remember, that only bonds with a \"sharp point\" towards the atom are considered. When creating SMILES the editor tries to guess missing stereo features, in unresolvable cases an error message is issued and the SMILES without stereo information is created. When the \"autoez\" option is set, SMILES with E,Z stereochemistry on all non-ring double bonds will be generated automatically. Without this keyword (or for ring double bonds) you have to mark a double bond as stereo by clicking on it with the stereo bond button selected. The bond color will change to magenta. Stereochemistry may be completely disabled by the \"nostereo\" option. Atom Numbering​ Atom numbering (marking) is enabled by the option \"number\" (for reaction input this is default).

JCAMP-DX file format​ JCAMP-DX (Joint Committee on Atomic and Molecular Physical Data Exchange) is a standard file format for the exchange of spectra and related physical and chemical information between different spectrometers, databases or other systems. The information is stored using ASCII characters and the file can be viewed, corrected and annotated with a text editor. The spectra are stored as a table containing (x,y) coordinate pairs. Besides the data points, it is possible to store metainformation and make comments. The file extension is .jdx. A JCAMP-DX document is composed of an unlimited number of Labelled Data Records (LDRs). Each LDR starts with a “##” and ends with “=”. Any space, comma, slash or hyphen is removed and the text is written with capital letters. Some examples of Data Labels: TITLE : title of the experiment END : the last line of the file XUNITS : the units reported on the x-axis NPOINTS : number of points Two important LDRs are “XYDATA” and “PEAKTABLE”, which contain the spectral information. The former gives information in the form of a table where the first value in a line stands for an x coordinate and any subsequent values are y-coordinates with an equidistant increment on the x-axis. The latter provides information as a collection of (X,Y) pairs. It is commonplace to compress the data tables. For instance, the table of numbers can be replaced by a line of characters (pseudo-digits). Among these pseudo-digits, there are PAC, SQZ, DIF, DIFDUP. An example of compressed data using DIFDUP An in depth description is given in the original paper by McDonald and Wilks. Insofar as JCAMP-DX is a well-described and accessible format, it partially aligns with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles . It is interoperable and reusable.

For this, we use finite differences of the form ∂2Ee∂xα∂yβ≈[(∂Ee∂yβ)∣xα=xα0+Δxα−(∂Ee∂yβ)∣xα=xα0−Δxα]/2Δxα\\frac{\\partial^{2} E_{e}}{\\partial x_{\\alpha} \\partial y_{\\beta}} \\approx\\left[\\left.\\left(\\frac{\\partial E_{e}}{\\partial y_{\\beta}}\\right)\\right|_{x_{\\alpha}=x_{\\alpha 0}+\\Delta x_{\\alpha}}-\\left.\\left(\\frac{\\partial E_{e}}{\\partial y_{\\beta}}\\right)\\right|_{x_{\\alpha}=x_{\\alpha 0}-\\Delta x_{\\alpha}}\\right] / 2 \\Delta x_{\\alpha}∂xα​∂yβ​∂2Ee​​≈[(∂yβ​∂Ee​​)∣∣∣∣∣​xα​=xα0​+Δxα​​−(∂yβ​∂Ee​​)∣∣∣∣∣​xα​=xα0​−Δxα​​]/2Δxα​ that is, we displace the atoms and then calculate the difference in forces/energies to numerically estimate the second derivative. If we have this matrix, we can solve the eigenvalue problem and get the normal modes with their frequencies. Conformer search In our case, conformer generation is based on a stochastic algorithm that generates random distances within bounds of minimum and maximum distances of pairs of elements. It turns out that these distance matrices can be projected into three dimensions, i.e., coordinates for every atom. To improve the performance of these distance geometry algorithms they are often refined using information, such as preferred torsional angles, extracted from the Cambridge Crystallographic database. Semi-empiricial quantum chemistry vs. force fields In the view, we give the option to select different methods for geometry optimization and calculation of the vibrational spectrum. Force-fields approximate the potential energy surface U(q)U(q)U(q) in some simple parametrization based on interaction terms between different atom pairs --- often for bonds, bends (angles), and torsions (dihedral angles) between different atom types. The force-field we use in the service is called GFN-NN. Its parameters were derived from fitting to DFT derived geometries, vibrational frequencies, and non-covalent interactions of about 8000 structures covering a wide range of chemistry. In contrast to other force field parametrizations it uses an electronegativity-equilibrium (EEQ) atomic-charge model to describe the electrostatic interactions, and it avoids element pair specific parametrization . From a computational point of view, GFN-FF's computational cost scales quadratically with system size. The other methods we offer are semi-empirical quantum-mechanical methods. The key idea behind semi-empirical methods such as the Hueckel method is that they approximate difficult integrals. An important flavor of semiempirical methods are density-functional tight-binding methods where the energy is expanded in terms of density fluctuations relative to a superposition of atomic reference densities: E[ρ(r)]=E[ρ0(r)]+∫δE[ρ(r)]δρ(r)∣ρ0δρ(r)+12∬δ2E[ρ(r)]δρ(r)δρ(r′)∣ρ0δρ(r)δρ(r′)…+1p!∬…∫δE[ρ(r′)]δρ(r)δρ(r′)…δρ(r(p))∣ρ0δρ(r)δρ(r′′)…δρ(r(p))+…\\begin{aligned} &E[\\rho(r)]=E\\left[\\rho_{0}(\\mathbf{r})\\right]+\\left.\\int \\frac{\\delta E[\\rho(\\mathbf{r})]}{\\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{r})}\\right|_{\\rho_{0}} \\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) \\\\ &+\\left.\\frac{1}{2} \\iint \\frac{\\delta^{2} E[\\rho(\\mathbf{r})]}{\\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) \\delta \\rho\\left(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}\\right)}\\right|_{\\rho_{0}} \\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) \\delta \\rho\\left(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}\\right) \\ldots \\\\ &+\\left.\\frac{1}{p !} \\iint \\ldots \\int \\frac{\\delta E\\left[\\rho\\left(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}\\right)\\right]}{\\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) \\delta \\rho\\left(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}\\right) \\ldots \\delta \\rho\\left(\\mathbf{r}^{(p)}\\right)}\\right|_{\\rho_{0}} \\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) \\delta \\rho\\left(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime \\prime}\\right) \\ldots \\delta \\rho\\left(\\mathbf{r}^{(\\mathbf{p})}\\right)+\\ldots \\end{aligned}​E[ρ(r)]=E[ρ0​(r)]+∫δρ(r)δE[ρ(r)]​∣∣∣∣∣​ρ0​​δρ(r)+21​∬δρ(r)δρ(r′)δ2E[ρ(r)]​∣∣∣∣∣​ρ0​​δρ(r)δρ(r′)…+p!1​∬…∫δρ(r)δρ(r′)…δρ(r(p))δE[ρ(r′)]​∣∣∣∣∣∣​ρ0​​δρ(r)δρ(r′′)…δρ(r(p))+…​ The GFN-xTB techniques build on top of this idea. In approximating the integrals, one introduces empirical parameters which in the GFN-xTB scheme are again fitted for atoms -- but not for the pairs (in contrast to conventional DFTB methods). warning Our simulations only consider an isolated molecule in gas phase for which the intensities and frequencies are typically different from the experimental ones. The intensities are particularly worse for the force-field method. Also, we do not consider any broadening effects (e.g., hydrogen bonds, solvents, rotational fine structure).","s":"Spectra from the Hessian","u":"/docs/eln/uuid/10b6a7229db7dd815afcc75e77c2d6cd","h":"#spectra-from-the-hessian","p":587},{"i":595,"t":"Key for the interpretation of the spectra is to realize that a system with NNN particles, has 3N3N3N degrees of freedom.

To say in other words, the \"first\" three degrees of freedom describe translations. In addition to changing the center of mass, the molecule can also rotate in different ways, which leaves the center of mass fixed. However, we have to make a distinction between linear and non-linear molecules. For linear molecules there is no rotation around the molecular axis -- you can explore this in the view if you compare carbon dioxide and water. For non-linear molecules, however, there are rotations around three distinct axes If we now subtract the translational and rotational modes we have 3N−53N-53N−5 vibrational degrees of freedom for linear molecules and 3N−63N-63N−6 vibrational degrees of freedom for non-linear molecules.

There you can select from different molecule collections, which will be simulated once you click the button. We currently provide a set of collection illustration important effects from organic chemistry, using the carbonyl stretching frequency as \"probe\". The important thing to remember throughout is that a stronger bond implies a higher force constant, which implies a higher wavenumber The inductive and mesomeric effect​ The two most widely discussed effects in organic chemistry are the inductive and mesomeric effect. The inductive effect describes changes in electron density that functional groups induce via σ\\sigmaσ bonds. Electron-withdrawing (electronegative) groups will attract electrons and hence make the neighboring atom more \"positive\". This will have an impact on the bond strength, which will manifest itself in the vibrational frequency. In contrast to that, the mesomeric effect is transmitted via π\\piπ bonds and can be visualized via resonance structures. Again, this has an effect on the electron density in neighboring bonds, which can be thought of changing the force constant and hence the vibrational frequency. Steric effects​ Clearly, there is a relation between structure and geometry. One example of this are sterically demanding substituents. Those might force the molecule to adopt a bent or rotated conformation. This can reduce the overlap between π\\piπ systems, and hence reduce the mesomeric effect--which will be reflected in the carbonyl stretching frequency. Ring strain​ In several types of reaction the driving force comes from release of so-called ring strain. Ring strain describes that the atoms are forced into a geometry \"they do not like\". Interestingly, those constrained geometries also have difference responses of neighboring bonds in the case of vibrations. For example, you will see in the animation that the bond lengths have to change much more in the case of small rings than in large rings. This can be thought of inducing a larger force constant, which manifests itself in an absorption at a higher wavenumber.","s":"Curated collections","u":"/docs/eln/uuid/10b6a7229db7dd815afcc75e77c2d6cd","h":"#curated-collections","p":587},{"i":601,"t":"To add a new series, you can right-click and move to the Series layer.

XPS is a technique based on the photoelectric effect, where an X-ray beam hits the material and electrons escape from the surface. These emitted photoelectrons reach then an electron energy analyser, which measures the kinetic energy, as well as a detector that counts the number of electrons. The data obtained corresponds to a spectrum in which the number of electrons are plotted as a function of the specific binding energy [eV] at which they were detected. Each element of the periodic table gives rise to a specific set of XPS peaks which also determines the electronic configuration (e.g. 1s, 2s, 2p, etc.).

Once selected you can move this molecule (just click around and drag the mouse). Molecule selection Even if the molecule does not appear as being selected you can still act on it. In instance, you can: copy to the molecule to the other side of the reaction by clicking on the arrow. click on the white rectangle to delete this selected molecule. JSME editor If you would like to draw efficiently the molecules directly in the editor click on the little question mark and try to learn all the shortcuts. JSME JSME Help and Basic Instructions​ JSME Menu​ shows molecule SMILES clears the editing area (or the current molecule, if structure contains several parts) starts new molecule component (when multipart option or reaction input are enabled) delete mode (click on atom or bond to delete it) deletes functional group - choose this option and then click bond connecting the group with the main skeleton starts atom numbering or reaction mapping (when this option is enabled) query atom / SMARTS (when this option is enabled) switches between allowed charged states on clicked atom reaction input (when reactions are enabled) undo redo next ring will be added as a spiro ring version information and link to the help page input stereo bond, click existing stereo bond to cycle through possible types (up, dowm, orientation) powerful chain tool, allows creation of various chains and rings; click single bond to change it to double allows input of inorganic atoms or atoms in nonstandard valence state (in this case enter the atom symbol enclosed in [], for example the carbene carbon will be [C]) opens functional group popup menu move selected atom useful when drawing crowded structures (visible when enabled in options) Basic Editing​ Rings are added connected by a single bond (when not added to a terminal atom); if you want to add a spiro ring press SHIFT ⇧ when adding it. An alternative way to add a spiro ring (that may be used also on touch devices) is to press the icon; the next ring will be then added as spiro. With single bond selected, a click on existing single bond changes it to double. With the powerful chain tool you can draw chains, saturated rings and by clicking on single bond change it to a double bond. Molecule may be moved by \"dragging\" free space and rotated by pressing also the SHIFT ⇧ key. JSME Keyboard Shortcuts​ If you are using JSME often, learn the following shortcuts. They will speed-up your editing considerably. ESC returns to the standard editing state (carbon, single bond) d or Del starts delete mode atoms C, N, O, P, S, F, L (for Cl), B (for Br), I, H, R bonds - for single bond, = for double bond rings 3..8 for 3 to 8 membered rings, 1 for phenyl and 0 for furyl groups a - COOH, y - NO2, z - SO3H, t - tert. butyl, ft - CF3 Stereochemistry​ Stereochemistry at C4 centers, double bonds and allenes is supported. Use the up / down wedge bonds to indicate stereochemistry at the C4 centers. Remember, that only bonds with a \"sharp point\" towards the atom are considered. When creating SMILES the editor tries to guess missing stereo features, in unresolvable cases an error message is issued and the SMILES without stereo information is created. When the \"autoez\" option is set, SMILES with E,Z stereochemistry on all non-ring double bonds will be generated automatically. Without this keyword (or for ring double bonds) you have to mark a double bond as stereo by clicking on it with the stereo bond button selected. The bond color will change to magenta. Stereochemistry may be completely disabled by the \"nostereo\" option. Atom Numbering​ Atom numbering (marking) is enabled by the option \"number\" (for reaction input this is default). Button appears in the menu. To mark an atom the \"numbering mode\" must be on, selected by clicking the 123 button. The atom number is chosen by pressing respective keys on your keyboard (i.e. 2 or 12); then atom(s) must be clicked. To delete the number pres 0 at your keyboard and then click the atom. Input of Multipart Structures​ By default only non-disconnected structures may be entered. This may be changed by a \"multipart\" option. A button appears in the menu. A new molecule may be started only after clicking this button, then selecting a proper template (atom, ring or bond) and clicking free space in the drawing area. Without clicking the NEW button first clicking the free space has the same effect as in the standard mode (i.e moving or rotation of the last touched molecule). In the multipart mode the button deletes the last touched molecule. Reaction Input​ Reaction input is enabled with the option \"reaction\". Buttons , and appear in the menu and arrow appears also in the drawing area. Now simply draw reactant(s), product(s) and modulator(s) (modulators have to be above the arrow) as explained in the description of input of multipart structures.

That is, if you want to upload a PXRD attachment to your sample you need to open the PXRD view. Explode nucleic and peptidic sequences The editor can explode peptide or nucleic acid sequences. Explode nucleic and peptidic sequences​ Most of the time you enter a peptidic or nucleic sequence as one letters code. However, it may happen that you have the terminal chain modified like in the case of a small tripeptide AAL that would have on the N-term a Boc and on the C-term a NH2. In order to enter correctly you should first enter the sequence AAL and then explode the sequence. You may then change the N-term and C-term. Coordinate covalent bond It can be useful to denote to have special bond types between metal and ligands in metal complexes. Our editor can deal with that. Drawing metal complexes​ The chemical structure editor (openchemlib) allows drawing coordinative covalent bonds. In order to draw a 'zero order' bond you need to first draw a single bond between an atom and a metal. With the single bond drawing tool selected you can then click on the bond couple of times in order to get the dotted bond. The molecular formula will be calculated automatically, and we consider, for this example, 3 different molecules. Groups Often it is more convenient to denote protective groups with Boc or amino acids with their three-letter code. Our editor understands this. Molecular formula: using groups​ While the molecular formula is calculated automatically from the chemical structure it is sometimes useful to directly edit the molecular formula. In the editor you are allowed to use groups like Ala, Me, ... The full list of allowed groups can be seen by clicking on the little grid icon. Editing the molecular formula (salts, isotopes) You can also directly edit the molecular formula, for example to indicate salts. Information about molecular formula​ While the molecular formula is calculated automatically from the chemical structure it is sometimes useful to directly edit the molecular formula. When you enter the molecular formula you may use the '.' to separate salt and also add charges in each part of the molecule. You will see an information about the molecular weight and monoisotopic mass of all the parts of the molecule in the Molecular formula information box This can also be useful to indicate isotopes. Molecular formula: isotopes​ While the molecular formula is calculated automatically from the chemical structure it is sometimes useful to directly edit the molecular formula. Isotopes have to be entered between square brackets like [13C]. There is one exception, D that is a synonym of [2H]. There is also the possibility to enter non-natural isotopic ratio. In this case the ratio between all the stable isotopes will be placed between curly brackets and separated by a comma. This is, if you have a molecule with 10 carbons having 20% [12C] and 80% [13C] you will enter C{20,80}10. You can also use parenthesis in your molecular formula. Molecular formula: parenthesis​ While the molecular formula is calculated automatically from the chemical structure it is sometimes useful to directly edit the molecular formula. The mass editor allows using as many parenthesis levels as you want. Dealing with modified peptide or nucleotide sequence You might need to deal with modifications at the terminal positions of your peptides. Deal with modified peptide or nucleotide sequences​ Peptides, proteins and nucleotides may contain non-natural amino acids or nucleic bases. They may also have chain modifications at the terminal positions. This could be the result of post-translational modifications (PTM), synthesis using non-natural amino acids, etc. In order to deal with those cases the system allows entering sequences using one-letter code and all the modifications in parentheses either at a terminal position or directly after the residue. Everything that is in parentheses will stay untouched and if a terminal position contains a parenthesis it will not be modified. Examples: Peptidic sequence AAA(NH2) = HAlaAlaAlaNH2 (Me)C(S-1Se)(NH2) = Selenocysteine with N-terminal methylated and C-terminal amide Nucleic sequence AA(C6H11O) = AA(C6H11O) : A dinucleotide on a glucose Printing reports and barcodes It can be handy to print out an overview table of all information about a sample, including a barcode. Print report and get barcode​ It is possible to print the report from any tab. You should simply click on the Print icon that is present in the description. This will produce a report that contains barcode that represent this specific sample. Modifying access rights You might need to give some colleague access to your sample, for example, to upload a characterization. Sample rights​ This view allows to manage the rights of samples: add a specific user (email address) add a specific group remove a specific user (email address) remove a specific group In order to proceed you should first select a list of samples to which the modification applies. There are 2 ways to select sample. The first is by clicking on the 'plus' symbol present on the right of the sample line. The second is by selecting some samples from the list and then clicking on the 'plus' symbol present on the top of the window. Once sample have been selected you can either Add or Delete a right by clicking on the corresponding button and entering an owner.

REGIONS OF INTEREST (ROIS) Many parameters are calculated for regions of interest. Information about ROIs Many parameters characterizing ROIs are automatically calculated. ROI​ Region Of Interest (ROI) posses various characteristics. Among them: Surface: the number of pixels in the ROI External: the number of pixels that touch at least one other external pixel Perimeter: ROI perimeter using cutting edge algorithm (see illustration) Diameter of a circle of equal projection area (DEQPC): DEQPC=2SurfaceπD_{EQPC} = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{Surface}{\\pi}}DEQPC​=2πSurface​​ Diameter of a circle of equal perimeter (DPED): DPED=ExternalπD_{PED} = \\frac{External}{\\pi}DPED​=πExternal​ Calculation of perimeter of pixel based images is not a trivial topic. This has been reviewed in the literature. In this tool we use the following approach: We count all the pixel sides that are outside the ROI (each side counts as 1) If a pixel has 2 external sides, we remove from the sum (2 - √2) = ~0.59 If a pixel has 3 external sides, we remove from the sum 2 * (2 - √2) = ~ 1.17 This means that for each border pixel the contribution to the perimeter is: pixels with one external side: 1 pixels with two external sides: ~1.41 pixels with three external sides: ~1.83 Practically the shape of the perimeter is represented in the following image: Minimum bounding rectangle (MBR)​ An information that allows to determine the shape of a ROI is the Minimum Bounding Rectange(MBR) that represents the smallest rectangle that surround the ROI. The MBR is characterized by: width: length of the longest side of the rectangle height: length of the smallest side of the rectangle perimeter: perimeter of the rectangle surface: surface of the rectangle Convex Hull (CH)​ The convex hull may be visualized as the shape enclosed by a rubber band stretched around the ROI. It is useful to estimate the compactness of the ROI. Two parameters are available for the convex hull: surface perimeter Feret diameters​ The feret diameters of a ROI can be calculated using a virtual caliper. 2 diameters are calculated: min: the minimal size of the ROI that could be measured using a caliper max: the maximal size of the ROI that could be measured by a caliper ψA (Aspect ratio): ratio of the minimum to the maximum Feret diameter (0 < ψA ≤ 1), an indication of the elongation of the particle Other parameters​ Sphericity​ The sphericity is the ratio of the perimeter of the equivalent circle, PPED, to the real perimeter, Preal. A perfect sphere as a sphericity of 1. The idea is that irregular shape causes an increase in the perimeter and therefore this ratio has a lower value. Knowing that the smallest possible perimeter for a given projection area is a circle, 0 < S ≤ 1. Please note that the evaluation of perimeter is a complex topic and check above the approach that is used in this application. It is not impossible that the sphericity is slightly higher than 1. S=PEQPCPrealS = \\frac{P_{EQPC}}{P_{real}}S=Preal​PEQPC​​ Convexity​ The convexity (ψC\\psi_CψC​) describes the compactness of a particle. The convexity is the ratio of the projection area itself and the area of the convex hull. The maximum theoretical convexity is 1, if there are no concave regions. Due to the pixelation of images, all particles seem to have small concave regions, corresponding to the tiny steps with every pixel in the perimeter line. Therefore, the maximum convexity calculated in reality is mostly limited to 0.99. ψC=ROIsurfaceCHsurface\\psi_C = \\frac{ROI_{surface}}{CH_{surface}}ψC​=CHsurface​ROIsurface​​ Roundness​ Roundness=4⋅ROIsurfaceπ⋅FeretmaxRoundness = \\frac{4 \\cdot ROI_{surface}}{π \\cdot Feret_{max}}Roundness=π⋅Feretmax​4⋅ROIsurface​​ Define pixel size Pixel size can be defined manually or automatically. Define pixel size In order to know the size of ROIs or annotations it is important to define the pixel size. In some case this information can be extracted from the meta information of the image. It can also be defined by the user using one of the 3 following approaches: From the list of images​ In the list of images you can directly double click on the pixel size and enter a value with the corresponding unit. From the annotations tab​ In the annotation tab you can click on the edit button on the top of the Pixel size box. You can also draw a line and specify the length of the line. This will calculate automatically the size of a pixel. Select ROIs Regions of interest may be selected before exportation.

Many monoisotopic masses at once It is possible to search for many monoisotopic masses at once. Simply SHIFT + click on other labels in order to have a comma separated list of monoisotopic mass. Molecular formula from monoisotopic mass​ This tool allows finding possible molecular formula for a specific observed monoisotopic mass. When the elements are part of H, C, O, N, F, Cl, Br, I, Si, P and O the monoisotopic mass corresponds to the peak of the isotopic distribution that has the lowest mass. However, by mass we don't observe a monoisotopic mass directly but always m/zm/zm/z of a charged form. The molecule may be charged positively, negatively, multicharged or also modified by the addition of protons or other charged entities. This tool will consider the mass of the electron and the number of charge of the molecule. Ionizations​ In order to observe a neutral molecule the mass spectrometer will charge it using different techniques. This may involve adding protons, remove electrons, etc. You can also observe charged molecules resulting of the addition of Na+, K+, etc. In order to evaluate all the possibilities you must enter in the 'ionizations' field a comma separated list of all the allowed ionizations.

Selection of spectra to analyze is achieved with one of those 3 methods: At the level of the sample by either clicking on the +, this will add all the spectra related to this sample or on the + on the top of the sample box to add all the spectra of all the selected samples. If you select a sample it is also possible to add a specific spectrum by clicking on the + at the level of the spectra list. Once spectra have been selected, data normalization filters can be applied : Spectrum preprocessing Apply mathematical tools to the spectra. Preprocessing​ Filters​ You can apply the following filters to the spectra to enhance the visualization. The modifications include the following: Center Mean : subtract the mean from every variable observation in the dataset, so that the new variable's mean is centered at 0. Center Median : subtract the median from every variable observation in the dataset, so that the new variable's median is centered at 0` Divide by SD : divide every variable observable in the dataset by the standard deviation yields a distribution with a standard deviation equal to 1. Normed: Specify a value in the value field and select the type of normalization: Sum to value: normalize the integral under the curve so that it sums to the specified value. Absolute sum to value: normalize the integral under the curve so that the absolute sum sums to the specified value. Max to value: normalize the maximum value to the specified value. Rescale (x to y) : rescale the graph such that the y-values fit between specified minimum and maximum values. First derivative : calculate the first derivative of the spectra. Second derivative : calculate the second derivative of the spectra. Third derivative : calculate the third derivative of the spectra. Savitzky-Golay : smooth the spectra and calculate derivatives based on the following parameters: Window: smoothing window size, must be an odd number, greater than 5. Derivative: derivative order. Polynomial: the degree of the polynomial used to calculate the Savitzky-Golay. AirPLS baseline : baseline correction using adaptive iterative reweighed penalized least squares algorithm. Iterative polynomial baseline : baseline correction using iterative polynomial fitting algorithm. Rolling average baseline : baseline correction using a rolling average. Rolling median baseline : baseline correction using a rolling median. Rolling ball baseline : baseline correction using a rolling ball. Ensure growing X values: ensure that the x-values are in increasing order. Function on X : apply a function to the x-values. For example, log(x). Function on Y : apply a function to the y-values. For example, log10(y+1). Calibrate X : calibrate the x-values with the parameters from, to, nbPeak and targetX.

Number of points​ Number of points can be changed to reduce the number of points in the spectra. The superimposed spectra can be manipulated without numerous : Visualization How to visualize spectra. Spectra visualization Numerous options are available to display the either all the spectra in the dataset or the selected spectra in the dataset. Selection of spectra in the dataset​ The toolbar on the top of the list of spectra in the dataset provides many options (from left to right): Remove all spectra from dataset Select category: select which property contains the category description Download normalized matrix Recolor spectra based on category: a different color will be applied for each category. By default, the sample reference Select all spectra Append to selected spectra Select only current spectra Remove spectra from current selection Unselect all spectra Graph options​ It is possible to either display the selected spectra, all the spectra or various derived information. Customization of the display is achieved using the chart toolbar: Display spectra​ The first options allow to either display all the spectra, only the selected spectra or nothing. Displaying no spectrum is useful when displaying other derived data. Original / normalized​ These options allow to either display the original spectra or the normalized data. Most of the time we will display normalized data. Those are the data that will be analyzed, and normally they also take less room in memory. Boxplot​ The boxplot kind of representation allows to display the first / third quartile as a dark grey zone for each X point. The min and max values are represented as a light gray zone and the median is represented as a line for which the color varies based on the standard deviation (red: high variation, blue: small variation). Tracking information​ By selecting the tracking information you will display the X values and the corresponding Y values for all the spectra. Correlation​ Correlation of the vector represented by the Y points can be useful to determine which peaks are correlated in a big mixture of products. This is known in NMR metabolomics as STOCSY. By SHIFT ⇧ + ALT + click you can select the X value for which you would like to check correlation. Strongly correlated signals will appear in red while non correlated signals are blue.","s":"Spectra selection, normalization and previsualization","u":"/docs/eln/uuid/739379c6183ec9beb757025314c40f8e","h":"#spectra-selection-normalization-and-previsualization","p":1022},{"i":1027,"t":"All the spectra analysis tools start with a phase of selection.","s":"Spectra selection","u":"/docs/eln/uuid/739379c6183ec9beb757025314c40f8e","h":"","p":1022},{"i":1029,"t":"In order to facilitate the analysis of the spectra it is advised to have samples containing representative spectra in order to evaluate the intra-variability as well as the reproducibility.

JCAMP-DX file format​ JCAMP-DX (Joint Committee on Atomic and Molecular Physical Data Exchange) is a standard file format for the exchange of spectra and related physical and chemical information between different spectrometers, databases or other systems. The information is stored using ASCII characters and the file can be viewed, corrected and annotated with a text editor. The spectra are stored as a table containing (x,y) coordinate pairs. Besides the data points, it is possible to store metainformation and make comments. The file extension is .jdx. A JCAMP-DX document is composed of an unlimited number of Labelled Data Records (LDRs). Each LDR starts with a “##” and ends with “=”. Any space, comma, slash or hyphen is removed and the text is written with capital letters. Some examples of Data Labels: TITLE : title of the experiment END : the last line of the file XUNITS : the units reported on the x-axis NPOINTS : number of points Two important LDRs are “XYDATA” and “PEAKTABLE”, which contain the spectral information. The former gives information in the form of a table where the first value in a line stands for an x coordinate and any subsequent values are y-coordinates with an equidistant increment on the x-axis. The latter provides information as a collection of (X,Y) pairs. It is commonplace to compress the data tables. For instance, the table of numbers can be replaced by a line of characters (pseudo-digits). Among these pseudo-digits, there are PAC, SQZ, DIF, DIFDUP.

Many data mining algorithms may help in those cases and here we propose to analyze the data using principal component analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables (here spectra) into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. If there are n observations with p variables, then the number of distinct principal components is min(n-1,p). This transformation is defined in such a way that the first principal component has the largest possible variance (that is, accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible), and each succeeding component in turn has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it is orthogonal to the preceding components. The resulting vectors (each being a linear combination of the variables and containing n observations) are an uncorrelated orthogonal basis set.

This tool is useful when navigating many samples. When you select a sample from the Home page and click the Structure search module, the chosen molecule will be searched by default. Alternatively, you may modify the structure in the OCL editor. The matching structures will be available in the tab on the right. note If a molecule appears in more than one sample, you can choose the entry in the List of samples tab. The right module displays the list of samples associated with the selected structure. Double-clicking a row will take you back to the main tab, with the corresponding sample selected in the List of selected samples. Double-clicking a row in the center module will take you directly to the first matching sample. There are two available search modes: by substructure and by similarity. Both are based on 512 molecule fragments. Each fragment is described by binary numbers, representing the presence or absence of certain attributes. In the case of substructure search, the matching molecules contain at least those fragments that were in the query substructure. The structure search uses the same algorithms implemented in Datawarrior. They are open source and available as part of openchemlib (https://github.com/actelion/openchemlib, https://github.com/cheminfo/openchemlib-js). The similarity search is based on Tanimoto algorithm. It uses the cumulated fragment value and compares the distance between two molecules in the descriptor space. The Tanimoto coefficient can take values between 0, for completely dissimilar molecules, and 1, for identical molecules. Beyond the threshold of 0.85, the molecules are considered similar. Structure edition is powered by [OCL editor]. Advanced Query Features Advanced Query features​ You can fine-tune the search by specifying atomic and bond properties. These options can be accessed by hovering over the atom or bond of interest and pressing q. For example, you can allow certain atoms at this specific position, or you can modify the ring size. Furthermore, you can include separate molecules in the search. This will result in structures containing both fragments with no restrictions on orientation or connectivity. One of the molecules can be selected and excluded from the search. It removes the structures completely from the search results. The excluded fragment is highlighted in pink. In addition, you can use the dropdown selector to choose whether to search a structure that contains all the fragments, a structure that contains any fragments, or by similarity. It is also possible to search for structures that contains experimental spectra. The following fields can be used in the search: nbNmr, nb1d, nb2d, nb13c, nb1h : number of spectrum registered for NMR, 1d NMR... nbMass, nbIR, nbTGA, nbDSC, nbRaman, nbMass, nbUV, nbXray : number of spectrum registered for IR, Raman ... mf, mw, em : molecular formula, molecular weight and exact mass (monoisotpic mass) title : title of the sample. meta : meta information. owner : name of the owner. modified : last modification date of the sample. created : creation date of the sample.

Spectra selection All the spectra analysis tools start with a phase of selection. Select samples​ In order to facilitate the analysis of the spectra it is advised to have samples containing representative spectra in order to evaluate the intra-variability as well as the reproducibility. Selection of spectra to analyze is achieved with one of those 3 methods: At the level of the sample by either clicking on the +, this will add all the spectra related to this sample or on the + on the top of the sample box to add all the spectra of all the selected samples. If you select a sample it is also possible to add a specific spectrum by clicking on the + at the level of the spectra list. Once spectra have been selected, data normalization filters can be applied : Spectrum preprocessing Apply mathematical tools to the spectra. Preprocessing​ Filters​ You can apply the following filters to the spectra to enhance the visualization. The modifications include the following: Center Mean : subtract the mean from every variable observation in the dataset, so that the new variable's mean is centered at 0. Center Median : subtract the median from every variable observation in the dataset, so that the new variable's median is centered at 0` Divide by SD : divide every variable observable in the dataset by the standard deviation yields a distribution with a standard deviation equal to 1. Normed: Specify a value in the value field and select the type of normalization: Sum to value: normalize the integral under the curve so that it sums to the specified value. Absolute sum to value: normalize the integral under the curve so that the absolute sum sums to the specified value. Max to value: normalize the maximum value to the specified value. Rescale (x to y) : rescale the graph such that the y-values fit between specified minimum and maximum values. First derivative : calculate the first derivative of the spectra. Second derivative : calculate the second derivative of the spectra. Third derivative : calculate the third derivative of the spectra. Savitzky-Golay : smooth the spectra and calculate derivatives based on the following parameters: Window: smoothing window size, must be an odd number, greater than 5. Derivative: derivative order. Polynomial: the degree of the polynomial used to calculate the Savitzky-Golay. AirPLS baseline : baseline correction using adaptive iterative reweighed penalized least squares algorithm. Iterative polynomial baseline : baseline correction using iterative polynomial fitting algorithm. Rolling average baseline : baseline correction using a rolling average. Rolling median baseline : baseline correction using a rolling median. Rolling ball baseline : baseline correction using a rolling ball. Ensure growing X values: ensure that the x-values are in increasing order. Function on X : apply a function to the x-values. For example, log(x). Function on Y : apply a function to the y-values. For example, log10(y+1). Calibrate X : calibrate the x-values with the parameters from, to, nbPeak and targetX. Pareto normalization : Pareto scaling, which uses the square root of standard deviation as the scaling factor, circumvents the amplification of noise by retaining a small portion of magnitude information. 10.1016/j.molstruc.2007.12.026 One classical preprocessing algorithm is Standard Normal Variate (SNV). This preprocessing can be achieved by selecting the 2 options Center mean and Divide by SD. Selecting the range​ A certain range of x-values can be selected to show only a part of the spectrum using Range. Exclusions​ Depending on the analysis, some regions should be removed using Exclusions in order to improve the visualization. Number of points​ Number of points can be changed to reduce the number of points in the spectra. The superimposed spectra can be manipulated without numerous : Visualization How to visualize spectra. Spectra visualization Numerous options are available to display the either all the spectra in the dataset or the selected spectra in the dataset. Selection of spectra in the dataset​ The toolbar on the top of the list of spectra in the dataset provides many options (from left to right): Remove all spectra from dataset Select category: select which property contains the category description Download normalized matrix Recolor spectra based on category: a different color will be applied for each category. By default, the sample reference Select all spectra Append to selected spectra Select only current spectra Remove spectra from current selection Unselect all spectra Graph options​ It is possible to either display the selected spectra, all the spectra or various derived information. Customization of the display is achieved using the chart toolbar: Display spectra​ The first options allow to either display all the spectra, only the selected spectra or nothing. Displaying no spectrum is useful when displaying other derived data. Original / normalized​ These options allow to either display the original spectra or the normalized data. Most of the time we will display normalized data. Those are the data that will be analyzed, and normally they also take less room in memory. Boxplot​ The boxplot kind of representation allows to display the first / third quartile as a dark grey zone for each X point. The min and max values are represented as a light gray zone and the median is represented as a line for which the color varies based on the standard deviation (red: high variation, blue: small variation). Tracking information​ By selecting the tracking information you will display the X values and the corresponding Y values for all the spectra. Correlation​ Correlation of the vector represented by the Y points can be useful to determine which peaks are correlated in a big mixture of products. This is known in NMR metabolomics as STOCSY. By SHIFT ⇧ + ALT + click you can select the X value for which you would like to check correlation. Strongly correlated signals will appear in red while non correlated signals are blue.","s":"Spectra selection, normalization and previsualization","u":"/docs/eln/uuid/c5a2739a6e2bb270fde2ceb278546fa0","h":"#spectra-selection-normalization-and-previsualization","p":1191},{"i":1196,"t":"All the spectra analysis tools start with a phase of selection.","s":"Spectra selection","u":"/docs/eln/uuid/c5a2739a6e2bb270fde2ceb278546fa0","h":"","p":1191},{"i":1198,"t":"In order to facilitate the analysis of the spectra it is advised to have samples containing representative spectra in order to evaluate the intra-variability as well as the reproducibility.

For example the unit type will store in the database the value using as units SI (we convert the data to the units defined by the 'standard international') and specify in which units the user would like to display the data. So in the following example we are in fact storing the value -150°C by storing the value in SI (Kelvin) and specifying that the user wants to see it in °C. { \"SI\": 123.15, \"unit\": \"°C\" } Another example is the valueUnits type that will store the data in 2 different properties (value and unit). In this case the value is stored in the specified units and there is no conversions. { \"value\": 123, \"units\": \"°C\" } While this way to store the data in the database is very practical it is not the way that the user would like to see his results. We have therefore the possibility to forceType: define how the user would like to see the results. Other types include mf.

Besides the data points, it is possible to store metainformation and make comments. The file extension is .jdx. A JCAMP-DX document is composed of an unlimited number of Labelled Data Records (LDRs). Each LDR starts with a “##” and ends with “=”. Any space, comma, slash or hyphen is removed and the text is written with capital letters. Some examples of Data Labels: TITLE : title of the experiment END : the last line of the file XUNITS : the units reported on the x-axis NPOINTS : number of points Two important LDRs are “XYDATA” and “PEAKTABLE”, which contain the spectral information. The former gives information in the form of a table where the first value in a line stands for an x coordinate and any subsequent values are y-coordinates with an equidistant increment on the x-axis. The latter provides information as a collection of (X,Y) pairs. It is commonplace to compress the data tables. For instance, the table of numbers can be replaced by a line of characters (pseudo-digits). Among these pseudo-digits, there are PAC, SQZ, DIF, DIFDUP. An example of compressed data using DIFDUP An in depth description is given in the original paper by McDonald and Wilks.

This can be achieved by comparing the observed mass spectrum to theoretical models of the expected isotopic distributions of the species in the sample. The tool takes as input a mass spectrum and generates all the theoretical isotopic distributions of all entities to look for. It then aligns the theoretical isotopic distribution to the centroids.

Use the up / down wedge bonds to indicate stereochemistry at the C4 centers. Remember, that only bonds with a \"sharp point\" towards the atom are considered. When creating SMILES the editor tries to guess missing stereo features, in unresolvable cases an error message is issued and the SMILES without stereo information is created. When the \"autoez\" option is set, SMILES with E,Z stereochemistry on all non-ring double bonds will be generated automatically. Without this keyword (or for ring double bonds) you have to mark a double bond as stereo by clicking on it with the stereo bond button selected. The bond color will change to magenta. Stereochemistry may be completely disabled by the \"nostereo\" option. Atom Numbering​ Atom numbering (marking) is enabled by the option \"number\" (for reaction input this is default).

Thus, the atom mapping tool is only available, when a reaction is edited. Query feature dialogs only open, when a substructure is edited, etc. Atom and Bond Hot-Keys​ Hot-keys allow to quickly change atom and bond types. When the mouse is moved over an atom or bond then the atom or bond is automatically highlighted, indicating that mouse clicks or pressing a hot-key affect the highlighted object. Hot-Key Type Name Explanation 'Delete' Atoms Bonds Mapping Delete Deletes highlighted and selected atoms and bonds. When a reaction is edited and the mapping tool is selected, then pressing the 'Delete' key removes all atom mapping from the reaction. '1','2','3', ... Atom Atom Chain Attaches a chain of 'n' carbon atoms to the highlighted atom provided that its valence maximum is not exceeded. 'a','b','c', ... Atom Atom Symbol Changes the symbol of the highlighted atom according to the typed sequence of atoms. E.g. typing 'n' followed by 'a' converts the atom to a sodium atom. '+', '-' Atom Charge Modifiers Increases or decreases the charge of the highlighted atom. '?' Atom Connection Point Converts an atom into a connection point of a substituent or building block. 'q' Atom, Bond Query Feature Dialog If a substructure query is edited then this key opens a query feature dialog, which allows to specify additional atom/bond conditions for the substructure search. '1','2','3' Bond Bond Order Changes the highlighted bond into a single, double or triple bond. 'u' Bond Up Bond Changes the highlighted bond into 'up' stereo bond, if at least one of the associated atoms is a relative or absolute stereo center. 'd' Bond Down Bond Changes the highlighted bond into 'down' stereo bond, if at least one of the associated atoms is a relative or absolute stereo center. 'c' Bond Cross Bond Changes the highlighted bond into a double bond with unknown configuration. '4','5','6','7' Bond Annelate Ring Annellates a new saturated ring with the respective ring size to the highlighted bond. 'b' Bond Annelate Benzo Annellates a new benzene ring to the highlighted bond. Buttons and Tools​ Chemical structures are drawn by selecting an appropriate tool and applying it while moving, clicking and dragging the mouse pointer over the drawing area. While the selection of a tool has no immidiate effect on the drawn structure, pressing a button does. Currently available buttons allow to clean up atom coordinates or to revert the most recent structure change. Button or Tool Name Explanation Atom Tools The Atom Tools cover atoms frequently used in organic chemistry. After selecting one of these tools, you may place new atoms by clicking into the empty space or change existing atom by clicking onto them. Atom Detail Tool Double clicking an atom with this tool selected will open a dialog window for specifying an unusual atom label, specific isotop, abnormal valence and/or radical state. When closing the dialog the double clicked atom is changed accordingly. The dialog settings are remembered applied to any other clicked atom, as long as the tool is selected. Charge Tools These tools let you assign charges to atoms. Multiple clicks on the same atom will increase or decrease the charge by 1. The Osiris Structure Editor assumes the presence of implicit hydrogens at any charged or non charged atoms to meet the atom's default valence. However, implicit hydrogens are only shown on hetero atoms. Ring Tools After selecting one of the predefined rings, one may create a new ring or attach a ring to an existing bond or atom to create annelated ring systems or a spiro compound, respectively. Bond Tools Bond Tools allow you to create new bonds and to change existing bonds concerning their order or stereo-orientation. By clicking into the open space you create a new bond of the selected type including two carbon atoms. Clicking onto an existing atom will attach a new carbon. Dragging the mouse from one atom to another one will just connect these atoms or increment the bond order between them, if they were already connected. If the plain single bond tool is selected, bonds may be multiply clicked to cycle through the possible bond orders. Where reasonable, it also toggles between double bonds with known or unknown configuration, the so-called cross bond. When using stereo bonds please consider that the pointed tip of the bond should always point to the stereo center. Chain Tool The Chain Tool provides the fastest way to draw aliphatic carbon chains in zig-zag orientation. With the selected Chain Tool click into the empty space or at an existing atom and drag the mouse to create a new zig-zag chain and flip its orientation. ESR Tools The editor supports the enhanced stereo recognition (ESR) introduced by Molecular Design Ltd. with IsisDraw V2.5. The ESR Tools allow to define for every stereo center, whether it is an absolute one or if it belongs to a group of stereo centers that have the drawn, but relative configuration. For any group of relative stereo centers one may define that the drawn and the inverse configurations are present, i.e. that we have a racemic situation concerning the group members. This is indicated by green stereo bonds and an ampersand '&' at the stereo centers. Likewise one may define groups of relative stereo centers that contain either the drawn configuration or the opposite one. Stereo centers of such a group are indicated by blue stereo bonds and the word 'or' at the stereo centers. In addition to the '&' or 'or' indicators group numbers show which stereo centers belong to the same group. Unknown Configuration Tool This symbol is used to denote an unknown stereo configuration at a chiral center. Cleanup Button A cleanup will generate new coordinates of an existing molecule. It rearranges bond and atom positions in order to have a proper 2D structure. If a part of the molecule or reaction is selected, the cleanup will retain the relative orientation of the non-selected atoms. Lasso Pointer Tool This tools allows you to select multiple atoms and bonds to rearrange, rotate, resize, delete or duplicate at the same time. Just drag the mouse pointer around the atoms of interest. Selected atoms and bonds are shown in red. By pressing the control key you switch to the rectangular selection mode and the SHIFT ⇧ key lets you add atoms to the current selection. By clicking onto an atom or bonds and dragging the mouse one may more it or all selected atoms, if the clicked one is selected. When pressing the SHIFT ⇧ key while dragging a selected fragment, an automatically created copy of the selected fragment is dragged. Where the editor needs to support multiple molecules, e.g. if a reaction is edited, then every reactant and product is indicated by a large light gray indicator in the background ('A', 'B', 'P1', etc.). Where independent fragments shall be treated as one molecule, e.g. anion and kation of one salt, one must locate those fragments close enough that there is only one indicator behind them. If a reaction or molecule query is edited, then one may double click an atom or a set of selected atoms to open a query feature dialog to specify additional conditions for a fragment to match in a substructure search. The same applies to individual or multiple selected bonds. If the edited object is not a query then double clicking of an atom or bond will just select the entire fragment. Delete Tool It allows you to delete individual atoms or bonds or selected parts of the molecule. Selected areas may also be removed by pressing the delete key from the keyboard. Zoom and Rotate Tool This tool allows to zoom or rotate the entire drawing or a selected subset. Just click at the intended origin for the rotation or zooming and drag the mouse vertically to zoom or horizontically to rotate. Mapping Tool This tool is only available when a reaction is edited. Use this tool to map reactant atoms to the respective product atoms. This is done by clicking on a reactant atom and dragging the mouse onto the corresponding product atom. The editor will acknowledge the link by displaying a red mapping number at both atoms. Afterwards it tries to map atoms in the vicinity automatically and displays green numbers at automatically mapped atoms. Please assign manually as many reactant-product pairs as are needed that the entire reaction is mapped completely and correctly. Pressing the 'Delete' key while this tool is selected removes all mapping from the reaction. Text Tool The text tool may only be selected in certain situations. If it is selected one may use it to place text elements directly into the drawing. These text elements will be integral part of the drawing and, thus, move, resize and rotate with the molecules or reaction.","s":"OpenChemLib Chemical Editor Concepts","u":"/docs/eln/uuid/ocl-editor","h":"#openchemlib-chemical-editor-concepts","p":1447},{"i":1451,"t":"In openchemlib editor it is possible to specify radicals.
